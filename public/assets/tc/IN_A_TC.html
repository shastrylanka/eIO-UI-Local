caps agreed by you and us in writing. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
we will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such budget caps,
however you agree that you will pay for any monthly fees that exceed any such
budget cap. We shall, in our sole discretion (a) decide the placement, timing,
frequency, and number of ad units or impressions delivered, which in turn may
impact the number of Actions, and.(b) calculate the monthly fees based on our
own measurements or those of our third party service providers. For dynamically
priced campaigns, your effective CPM will be determined based on your target
goals (e.g. CPC, CPA, or CPM). You hereby give us the right to adjust the
location of and price for your ads (if any) as long as the overall effective
CPM for your campaign does not exceed any budget caps agreed by the parties.
When you use a Yahoo pre-approved third party ad server, which cannot account
for dynamic pricing, we will report total cost to you in order for you to
accurately determine your effective CPM. </span></p>
