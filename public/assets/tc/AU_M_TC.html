<p>1. <b>PROGRAM USE.</b> We provide you access to the Program for display advertising ("<b>Display Advertising Program</b>") for your use. You will pay for all impressions and/or clicks on your ads that we deliver, as measured by us. "<b>Performance Ads</b>" are ads which are displayed on a space-available basis and are not guaranteed to appear in the Distribution Network, and are designated as such or as Class 2 ads in an Insertion Order. Your charges for Performance Ads are based on actual delivery of impressions as measured by us. Except with respect to Performance Ads, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver impressions in the amounts and locations by the end of the period specified in an Insertion Order, as applicable. </p>

<p>2. <b>PLACEMENT OF ADS.</b> If your Information, including any updates, is not given to us four (4) business days prior to its anticipated distribution (or ten (10) business days in respect of rich media ads) or does not conform to our policies and specifications, including the policies and specifications located at <a href="http://au.adspecs.yahoo.com/">http://au.adspecs.yahoo.com/</a>, we may at our sole discretion choose not to publish your ad but reserve the right to bill you at the rates in the Insertion Order. We may optimize your campaign by modifying the line items of an Insertion Order. Unless otherwise agreed by us, we must approve in advance in writing the serving of ads by anyone other than us. For ads in an Insertion Order that specify frequency caps, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such frequency caps, provided that you agree that we are not liable if your ads are viewed in excess of the frequency cap. For dynamically priced campaigns, we may adjust the location of, and price for, your ads in an effort to meet your target goals (e.g., CPC, CPA, or CPM).</p>

<p>3. <b>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</b> Except for Performance Ads, if we fail to publish your ads or deliver, by the end of the period specified in an Insertion Order, the aggregate number of impressions and/or clicks as agreed in the Insertion Order (subject to any reductions permitted under Section 2, above) or the impressions and/or clicks are delivered in the wrong location, then (i) for purposes of this Section 3 of the Display Advertising Program Terms only, the first sentence of Section 10 of the Master Terms and Conditions does not apply, (ii) your sole and exclusive remedy is limited to the following, which we may choose in our discretion: (a) a pro rata refund of the charges representing the impressions and/or clicks that were not published, undelivered or delivered to the wrong location, (b) delivery of the impressions and/or clicks at a later time in a comparable position as determined by us, and/or (c) an extension of the term of the Insertion Order with a refund representing any remaining unpublished or undelivered impressions and/or clicks at the end of such extended term.</p>

<p>4. <b>CONVERSION PIXELS.</b> For any CPA campaign, we shall, and you shall render us your full cooperation to, install and make fully functional as soon as reasonably practicable the Conversion Pixels on the your website(s) in accordance with the proposed campaign start date specified in the Insertion Order. If after three (3) months from the date of the Insertion Order, we have not been able to install the Conversion Pixels on your or your client’s website, then the Agreement will terminate. You undertake and agree not to remove, alter, decompile, tamper with or deactivate the Conversion Pixels in any manner whatsoever without our prior written consent, and you will provide us with a minimum of 48 hours written notice if the Conversion Pixels are to be removed from your website. You acknowledge that, in the event that the Conversion Pixels are removed, tampered with or deactivated in breach of the Agreement, we have the right to charge you $1.50 gross per thousand impressions generated by the campaign from the time conversions stop being recorded by us. In such event, we shall notify you as soon as practicable and put the campaign on hold until you confirm to us in writing that the Conversion Pixels have been replaced and our tests have confirmed that the Conversion Pixels have been completely and correctly installed. "<b>Conversion Pixels</b>" means Yahoo!7’s tags (or the tags of our nominated third party) on your confirmation page or any other code or file inserted or placed by us (or our nominated third party) on your website for the purposes of calculating the charges due from you.</p>

<p>5. <b>METRICS.</b> The CPM, CPC or CPA amount for any campaign shall be specified in the Insertion Order or otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. For the purposes of calculating CPA campaigns, an action ("<b>Action</b>") occurs when a user clicks on or is exposed to your ad on the Distribution Network and subsequently visits your website within the negotiated time frame and triggers the delivery of the Conversion Pixel to the user. The fees payable by you shall be the number of Actions (if any) multiplied by the CPA and subject to any overall caps agreed by you and us in writing. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such budget caps, however you agree that you will pay for any monthly fees that exceed any such budget cap. We shall, in our sole discretion (a) decide the placement, timing, frequency, and number of ad units or impressions delivered, which in turn may impact the number of Actions, and.(b) calculate the monthly fees based on our own measurements or those of our third party service providers. For dynamically priced campaigns in respect of Performance Ads, your effective CPM will be determined based on your target goals (e.g. CPC, CPA, or CPM). You hereby give us the right to adjust the location of and price for your ads (if any) as long as the overall effective CPM for your campaign does not exceed any budget caps agreed by the parties. When you use a Yahoo!7 pre-approved third party ad server, which cannot account for dynamic pricing, we will report total cost to you in order for you to accurately determine your effective CPM.</p>

<p>6. <b>MODIFICATIONS.</b> In addition to modifying the Insertion Order in writing signed by you and us, you agree that: (i) certain details of the Insertion Order may be modified through an e-mail exchange whereby one party sets forth proposed new terms and the other party confirms such terms (an "<b>Email Modification</b>"), and (ii) the scope of an Email Modification may only encompass changes (as applicable) to: the pricing type (CPM, CPC, CPA etc), the budget cap (including the impression goal total, the dollar value total and the unit cost), the targeting, the flight dates, the frequency cap, and/or the property, application, media, or devices on which the Ad Units may run. Email Modifications shall not take effect until we have processed the amendments. All notices, requests and other communications relating to the Insertion Order shall specify the Insertion Order number.</p>

<p>7. <b>USER INFORMATION AND TRACKING TAGS. </b>(a) All Information must not contain any cookie, tracking tag or other tracking device unless we have provided our prior written consent to such inclusion, (b) To the extent we consent to you collecting information relating to our users, including PII ("<b>User Information</b>"), you may only use such information for your internal statistical purposes and solely in respect of the advertising campaign the subject of the Insertion Order or Program Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, you must not disclose any User Information to any third party, and must not use any User Information in connection with any advertising campaigns on any third party properties or websites. If you are a Representative, this does not prevent you from disclosing the User Information in summary format only to the Advertiser, provided you procure that the Advertiser only uses such information in accordance with this paragraph (b), and (c) Without limiting our rights or remedies, we may immediately remove any advertisement or terminate the Insertion Order without liability in the event of any breach by you (or the Advertiser) of this Section 7. Any such termination will not affect your obligation to make payment in accordance with the Insertion Order.</p>
