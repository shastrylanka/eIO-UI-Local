<p><b>Standard Terms and Conditions for Yahoo! Advertising</b></p>

<p>The following terms and conditions (the &quot;<b>Standard Terms</b>&quot;) shall be deemed to be incorporated into each advertising insertion order that references these Standard Terms (each, an &quot;<b>Insertion Order</b>&quot;) between Yahoo! Canada Co. (&quot;<b>Yahoo!</b>&quot;) and Advertiser:</p>

<p><b>1. Terms of Payment.</b> Advertiser must submit completed credit application to determine terms of payment. If no credit application is submitted or the request for credit is denied by Yahoo! in its sole discretion, the Insertion Order must be paid in advance of the advertisement start date. Major credit cards (VISA, M/C and American Express) are accepted. If Yahoo! approves credit, Advertiser will be invoiced monthly and payment shall be made to Yahoo! within thirty (30) days from the date of invoice (&quot;<b>Due Date</b>&quot;). Amounts paid after the Due Date shall bear interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). In the event Advertiser fails to make timely payment, Advertiser will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including legal fees) incurred by Yahoo! in collecting such amounts. Yahoo! reserves the right to suspend performance of its obligations hereunder (or under any other agreement with Advertiser) in the event Advertiser fails to make timely payment hereunder or under any other agreement with Yahoo!.</p>

<p><b>2. Positioning/Delivery.</b> Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Insertion Order, positioning of advertisements within the Yahoo! properties or on any page is at the sole discretion of Yahoo!. Yahoo! may, at its sole discretion, remove from the insertion order (and substitute with similar inventory) any keyword or category page that it believes to be a trademark, trade name, company name, product name or brand name belonging to or claimed by a third party.  Yahoo! may optimize Advertiser's campaign by modifying the line items of an Insertion Order.  As may be specified in the Insertion Order, Yahoo! may deliver advertisements on a space available, pre-emptible basis (&quot;<b>Preemptible Advertisements</b>&quot;).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Insertion Order or these Standard Terms, with respect to Preemptible Advertisements, Advertiser will pay only for the impressions actually served, and Yahoo! has no duty or obligation, express or implied, to publish, post, host, stream or otherwise deliver any impressions in any Yahoo! property or third party property.   Yahoo! makes no guarantees with respect to clicks, acquisitions or levels of impressions for any Preemptible Advertisements and any click, acquisition or impression make-good provisions contained herein shall not apply to Preemptible Advertisements.  As may be specified in the Insertion Order, Yahoo! may deliver advertisements on the network of advertising channels, including all forms of media, applications, and devices, through which Yahoo! distributes advertisements (whether on or off web site pages, properties, content, and/or applications that are owned, operated, authorized, or hosted by or for Yahoo!, and which may include third party web sites, properties, content, or applications) (the &quot;<b>Distribution Network</b>&quot;).</p>

<p><b>3. Usage Statistics.</b> Unless specified in the Insertion Order, Yahoo! makes no guarantees with respect to usage statistics or levels of impressions for any advertisement. Advertiser acknowledges that delivery statistics provided by Yahoo! are the official, definitive measurements of Yahoo!'s performance on any delivery obligations provided in the Insertion Order. The processes and technology used to generate such statistics have been certified and audited by an independent agency. No other measurements or usage statistics (including those of Advertiser or a third party ad server) shall be accepted by Yahoo! or have bearing on the Insertion Order.</p>

<p><b>4. Renewal.</b> Except as expressly set forth in the Insertion Order, any renewal of the Insertion Order and acceptance of any additional advertising order shall be at Yahoo!'s sole discretion. Pricing for any renewal period is subject to change by Yahoo! from time to time.</p>

<p><b>5. No Assignment or Resale of Ad Space.</b> Advertiser may not resell, assign or transfer any of its rights hereunder, and any attempt to resell, assign or transfer such rights shall result in immediate termination of this contract, without liability to Yahoo!.</p>

<p><b>6. Limitation of Liability.</b> In the event (i) Yahoo! fails to publish an advertisement in accordance with the schedule provided in the Insertion Order, (ii) Yahoo! fails to deliver the number of total page views specified in the Insertion Order (if any) by the end of the specified period, or (iii) of any other failure, technical or otherwise, of such advertisement to appear as provided in the Insertion Order, the sole liability of Yahoo! to Advertiser shall be limited to, at Yahoo!'s sole discretion, a pro rata refund of the advertising fee representing undelivered page views, placement of the advertisement at a later time in a comparable position, or extension of the term of the Insertion Order until total page views are delivered. In no event shall Yahoo! be responsible for any consequential, special, punitive or other damages, including, without limitation, lost revenue or profits, in any way arising out of or related to the Insertion Order/Standard Terms or publication of the advertisement, even if Yahoo! has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Without limiting the foregoing, Yahoo! shall have no liability for any failure or delay resulting from any governmental action, fire, flood, insurrection, earthquake, power failure, riot, explosion, embargo, strikes whether legal or illegal, labor or material shortage, transportation interruption of any kind, work slowdown or any other condition beyond the control of Yahoo! affecting production or delivery in any manner.</p>

<p><b>7. Advertisers Representations; Indemnification.</b> Advertisements are accepted upon the representation that Advertiser has the right to publish the contents of the advertisement without infringing the rights of any third party and without violating any law. In consideration of such publication, Advertiser agrees, at its own expense, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Yahoo!, and its employees, representatives, agents and affiliates, against any and all expenses and losses of any kind (including reasonable legal fees and costs) incurred by Yahoo! in connection with any claims, administrative proceedings or criminal investigations of any kind arising out of publication of the advertisement and/or any material, product or service of Advertiser to which users can link through the advertisement (including without limitation, any claim of trademark or copyright infringement, defamation, breach of confidentiality, privacy violation, false or deceptive advertising or sales practices).</p>

<p><b>8. Provision of Advertising Materials.</b> Advertiser will provide all materials for the advertisement in accordance with Yahoo!'s policies in effect from time to time, including (without limitation) the manner of transmission to Yahoo! and the lead-time prior to publication of the advertisement and such technical specifications as Yahoo! may require from time to time. If Advertiser does not provide all materials, at least three (3) business days (for standard advertisements) or five (5) business days (for rich media and video advertisements) prior to its anticipated distribution or does not conform to Yahoo!'s policies and specifications, Yahoo! may distribute, at its option: (i) back-up advertisements based on materials Advertiser has previously given Yahoo! or (ii) public service announcements of Yahoo!'s choice, and charge Advertiser at the rates in the Insertion Order. Yahoo! shall not be required to publish any advertisement that is not received in accordance with such policies and reserves the right to charge Advertiser, at the rate specified in the Insertion Order, for inventory held by Yahoo! pending receipt of acceptable materials from Advertiser which are past due. Advertiser hereby grants to Yahoo! a non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid license to use, reproduce and display the advertisement (and the contents, trademarks and brand features contained therein) in accordance herewith.</p>

<p><b>9. Right to Reject Advertisement.</b> All contents of advertisements are subject to Yahoo!'s approval. Yahoo! reserves the right to reject or cancel any advertisement, insertion order, URL link, space reservation or position commitment, at any time, for any reason whatsoever (including belief by Yahoo! that placement of advertisement, URL link, etc., may subject Yahoo! to criminal or civil liability).</p>

<p><b>10. Cancellations.</b> Except as otherwise provided in the Insertion Order, the Insertion Order is non-cancelable by Advertiser.</p>

<p><b>11. Construction.</b> No conditions other than those set forth in the Insertion Order or these Standard Terms shall be binding on Yahoo! unless expressly agreed to in writing by Yahoo!. In the event of any inconsistency between the Insertion Order and the Standard Terms, the Standard Terms shall control.</p>

<p><b>12. Miscellaneous.</b> These Standard Terms, together with the Insertion Order, (i) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with, the laws of the province of Ontario, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law; (ii) may be amended only by a written agreement executed by an authorized representative of each party; and (iii) constitute the complete and entire expression of the agreement between the parties, and shall supersede any and all other agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties. Clauses 6, 7, and 12 will survive any expiry or termination of these Standard Terms.  Yahoo!'s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a wavier of such right or provision. Advertiser shall make no public announcement regarding the existence or content of the Insertion Order without Yahoo!'s written approval, which may be withheld at Yahoo!'s sole discretion. Both parties consent to the jurisdiction of the courts of the province of Ontario with respect to any legal proceeding arising in connection with the Insertion Order/Standard Terms.</p>

<p><b>13. Third Party Ad Serving.</b> If Yahoo! has approved the use by Advertiser of a third party ad server (&quot;<b>Third Party Server</b>&quot;) in connection with this Insertion Order, the following provisions shall also apply:</p>

<p>(i) The Advertiser shall post each advertisement to a staging area and shall notify Yahoo! of such posting at least three (3) business days (for standard advertisements) or five (5) business days (for rich media and video advertisements) prior to the date on which Third Party Server is scheduled to serve such advertisement to a Yahoo! property. Such advertisement shall be reviewed by Yahoo! and must be approved in writing by Yahoo! before it can be served by Third Party Server. In accordance with Section 9, Yahoo! reserves the right to reject any advertisement or any element thereof, for any reason in its sole discretion.</p>

<p>(ii) The Advertiser shall post all scheduling changes, new target URLs, new HTML specifications, new graphics and all other new or revised advertisements (&quot;<b>Revisions</b>&quot;) to a staging area and shall notify Yahoo! of such posting at least (4) business days prior to the date Advertiser wishes such Revisions to take effect. Revisions shall not be implemented until approved by Yahoo! in writing, which approval shall be at Yahoo!'s sole discretion.</p>

<p>(iii) If Advertiser discovers that Advertiser or Third Party Server has served, or caused to be served, an advertisement to a Yahoo! property in violation of this Agreement, Advertiser must immediately provide notice to Yahoo! of the violation (along with a written explanation) and remove the advertisement from its placement or rotation on the Yahoo! properties. Nothing in this Section shall limit any of Yahoo!'s rights or remedies in the event of such breach.</p>

<p>(iv) In the event Yahoo! exercises its right to cancel an advertisement in accordance with Section 9 hereof, Yahoo! shall notify Advertiser in writing. The Advertiser must cause the advertisement to be removed from the Yahoo! properties and from its advertising rotation no later than four (4) hours after written notification by Yahoo!.</p>
