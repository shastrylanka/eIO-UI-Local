<b><span style='font-weight:bold'>1. INTRODUCTION&nbsp; </span></b><br>
We provide you with certain services which enable you to advertise your goods
and/or services through Yahoo!'s Distribution Network, subject to: (i) these
terms and conditions (the &quot;Master Terms and Conditions&quot;); (ii) any
additional terms and conditions of the specific programmes to which you
subscribe for advertising purposes (the &quot;Programmes&quot;) (the
&quot;Programme Terms&quot;); and (iii) where applicable, the terms and
conditions of any applicable insertion order(s) that you enter into which
specifically refers to these Master Terms and Conditions or applicable
Programme Terms (each an &quot;Insertion Order&quot;), each of which are hereby
incorporated by reference and together with these Master Terms and Conditions
form the &quot;Agreement&quot;. <br>
<br>
Terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms
in the Insertion Order or applicable Programme Terms unless expressly provided
otherwise.&nbsp; All definitions shall apply both to their singular and plural
forms, as the context may require. Headings used in the Agreement are for
convenience only. <br>
The Agreement will commence from the date on which Yahoo! first provides you
with access to one or more Programmes, and will continue until terminated in
accordance with the Agreement (the &quot;Term&quot;). <br>
<br>
<b><span style='font-weight:bold'>2. PAYMENT.</span></b>&nbsp; You shall pay
all charges to your account in the currency, manner and form required by us
from time to time.&nbsp; Our measurements are the definitive measurements to
calculate your charges.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we have determined that you may be
charged on an invoice basis, we will submit an invoice to you at the e-mail or
mailing address (at our discretion) on the Insertion Order or as required by
applicable law, and you shall pay such charges, without offset or deduction,
within 30 days of the invoice date. If we agree to your request to send an
invoice to a third party on your behalf, you shall ensure that such third party
pays the invoice on time and, if it does not do so, you shall pay all amounts
owing under such invoice immediately.<br>
If we do not receive timely payment, you shall pay all amounts due on your
account upon demand and, in addition to any other rights, we may suspend
performance, remove your Advertiser Materials, and/or terminate the Agreement
or any part of it. <br>
<br>
All payments of service fees, unused promotional credits and initial deposit(s)
are non-refundable.&nbsp; You agree to submit any dispute about: (a) any of our
usage statistics on any Advertiser Materials as soon as reasonably practicable
and in any event within 60 days from the recording of the statistic in dispute;
and (b) any other charges to your account, in writing to us as soon as
reasonably practicable and (in respect of invoiced advertisers) in any event
before the due date for payment of such charges.&nbsp; If you do not meet these
conditions, you waive any right to raise any dispute. <br>
<br>
All charges are, unless otherwise stated, payable in pounds sterling together
with VAT and any other applicable taxes.&nbsp; We may charge you interest at
the rate of three percent (3%)&nbsp; per month (or the highest rate permitted
by law, if less) above the base lending rate of Yahoo!'s main bank on all
amounts due and payable&nbsp; until payment is received, whether before or after
judgment. If you fail to pay, Yahoo! may charge you for all costs incurred by
Yahoo! in connection with collecting the amounts due.<br>
<br>
We may change the amount of any fees or charges or any amounts you are required
to maintain on account with us in respect of any Programme to which you
subscribe&nbsp; by giving you notice either in writing (including by email) or
on the Yahoo! Company Sites. If you do not agree to such changes, you must
immediately: (i) notify us in writing; and (ii) stop using the relevant Programme(s).<br>
<br>
<b><span style='font-weight:bold'>3. PAYMENT DEPOSITS.</span></b>&nbsp; We may
require you to pay a deposit to us as security for fulfilment of your payment
obligations in respect of any Programme to which you subscribe (‘Payment
Deposit').<br>
In the event that you pay a Payment Deposit, the following terms and conditions
apply: (a) the Payment Deposit will not be offset against future invoices
payable by you; (b) provided that you have met your payment obligations under
the Agreement in full, following termination or expiry of the Agreement the
Payment Deposit will be refunded to you in full (without any interest accrued
from the date of receipt of the Payment Deposit by Yahoo!); (c) if you fail to
make payment in full in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, your
Payment Deposit shall be forfeited and shall remain with Yahoo!: (i) until such
time your payment obligations under the Agreement have been made in full to the
satisfaction of Yahoo!, together with any interest due on those payments in
accordance with the terms of the Agreement; and (ii) if your payment
obligations under the Agreement have not been fulfilled to the satisfaction of
Yahoo! by six months from either 1. termination or expiry of the Agreement; or
2. the date of the invoices under which such payments are due, we shall offset
your Payment Deposit against those outstanding payments due from you (together
with any interest accrued on those outstanding payments in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement).<br>
<br>
Yahoo! shall return any balance of the Payment Deposit (without any interest accrued
from the date of receipt of the Payment Deposit by Yahoo!) after your payment
obligations under the Agreement have been satisfied in full.<br>
<br>
<b><span style='font-weight:bold'>4. ACCESS.</span></b>&nbsp; You will not and
will not permit anyone to: (i) use any automated means to access, monitor, or
manage your account with us, or to access, monitor, or copy the Yahoo! Company
Sites or any part of them, except where made available or authorised in writing
by us; (ii) bypass any robot exclusion headers on the Yahoo! Company Sites;
(iii) interfere, or attempt to interfere, with the operation of the Yahoo!
Company Sites or systems, or Programmes; (iv) use the Programmes in connection
with open source software in any way which would create any obligations of use
with respect to our Programmes or grant to any third party any rights to or
immunities under our Intellectual Property Rights in our Programmes;or (v) use
our Programmes in connection with any activity which may, directly or
indirectly, cause property damage, death or personal injury.<br>
Your right to access your account(s) is non?assignable and subject to any
limits imposed by Yahoo! from time to time. You shall not allow any third party
to use any Programme, except your Authorised Users and employees in accordance
with the Agreement. <br>
<br>
You agree to notify us promptly in writing if you become aware of a breach, or
potential breach, of security relating to your account(s). You shall ensure
that Authorised Users and employees comply with the Agreement, and you are
liable for all of their acts and omissions in connection therewith. <br>
You may use data made available to you in connection with a Programme solely
for internal use to manage your account(s) and you may not publish any such
data, nor create profiles of our users. <br>
In order to improve our Programmes, we frequently conduct tests and you agree
to pay all charges and any other expenses for the services rendered (as set
forth in the applicable Insertion Order or your online account) during those
testing periods.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<b><span style='font-weight:bold'>5. YOUR SITE.&nbsp;</span></b> We are not
responsible for any aspect of your or any third-party site(s). <br>
<br>
<b><span style='font-weight:bold'>6.&nbsp; API ACCESS.</span></b>&nbsp; If we
grant you API Access in connection with a Programme, this Section shall apply
to you and API Access and the API Code (defined below) are part of such
Programme. <br>
<br>
&quot;API Access&quot; is the ability, via the API Code, to access certain
account information and/or features, and to execute commands for your
account(s).&nbsp; You may not use your API Access, including any data obtained,
for purposes other than managing your account(s) to which the API Access
relates.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your use of a Programme terminates, your API Access to
that Programme shall terminate immediately.&nbsp; We may limit, modify or
terminate your API Access, at our discretion, at any time, and such
modifications may require you to make changes, at your expense, to the API Code
for continued API Access.&nbsp; &quot;API Code&quot; is software created by you
or us using an XML/SOAP interface we specify enabling API Access. <br>
<br>
If we give you API Code or software to incorporate into API Code developed by
you, we grant you a non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable,
non-sublicensable, limited, licence to use the API Code or software given to
you by us for internal use solely for API Access during the term of the
applicable Programme Terms. You shall make the API Code available to us upon
our request for our review and notify us of the features and functionality of
such API Code and the application to which the API Code connects.&nbsp; Your
use of API Code shall not exceed access frequency limits as set by us from time
to time.&nbsp; If you are a Representative (defined below) this Section gives
you (not the Advertisers), API Access.&nbsp; You may not use API Access
pursuant to this Section if you are party to another agreement with a Yahoo!
Company that provides for such access.<br>
<br>
<b><span style='font-weight:bold'>7.&nbsp; USE OF INFORMATION.&nbsp;</span></b>
You grant each Yahoo! Entity an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
worldwide, fully paid licence throughout the Term to:&nbsp; (i) use, copy,
and/or modify, adapt, reformat, recompile, disassemble, reverse engineer and/or
manipulate any part of the Advertiser Materials, or any URL provided within
your Advertiser Materials, including for public performance or display,
marketing and distribution, in any part of the Distribution Network; and/or
(ii) access, index, cache and display the site(s), or any portion thereof, to
which your Advertiser Materials link,&nbsp; by any means, including web spiders
and/or crawlers.<br>
<br>
In the event that you use a suggestion or modification to your Advertiser
Materials made by a Yahoo! Entity, you agree that: (a) such suggestion or
modification is authorised by you and complies with the Agreement; and (b) none
of the Yahoo! Entities shall have any liability for your Advertiser Materials,
or any changes to them. <br>
All Advertiser Materials are subject to our approval. We reserve the right at
any time in our absolute discretion to: (a) reject, amend, remove or cancel any
Advertiser Materials, Insertion Order, URL link, space reservation or position
commitment; and/ or (b) remove any Advertiser Materials from any of the Yahoo!
Company Sites and/or any part of the Distribution Network.&nbsp; We do not
undertake to review the contents of any Advertiser Materials and any review
and/or approval by us will not be deemed to constitute an acceptance by us that
they comply with the Agreement or any waiver of any of our rights under it.<br>
<br>
We do not guarantee that your Advertiser Materials will be distributed in any
part of the Distribution Network, nor do we guarantee that your Advertiser
Materials will appear in a particular position or rank. The final decision as
to inclusion and placement of Advertiser Materials is at our discretion.<br>
<br>
You grant to Yahoo! the express right to reproduce throughout the world screen
shots of all or part of any Yahoo! property containing all or part of any of
the Advertiser Materials on or in any promotional or advertising material or
campaign promoting or advertising Yahoo! (but not any promotional or
advertising campaign paid for by Yahoo!).<br>
Notwithstanding the provisions of any Insertion Order, you acknowledge and
agree that we have not made any guarantees with respect to usage statistics,
including levels of impressions, click-throughs or positioning of any
Advertiser Materials. We are not liable for any usage statistics however
supplied. You acknowledge that usage statistics we provide are the official,
definitive measurements of our performance on any delivery obligations provided
in the Insertion Order. The processes and technology used to generate such
statistics have been independently audited.<br>
<br>
All software, hardware, equipment, systems and underlying technology, and all
other data, information and content residing or subsisting in or created,
collected or processed&nbsp; using the Yahoo! Company Sites, Programmes and any
sites of any Yahoo! Companies or Distribution Network (including&nbsp; all
Intellectual Property Rights residing or subsisting therein) is or are owned by
Yahoo! or its licensors and if and to the extent that any such rights become
vested in you, you will effectively assign to Yahoo! absolutely and
unconditionally all such rights.<br>
<br>
The Programmes are proprietary to us and are protected by the applicable
intellectual property Laws (as defined in Section 9 (Representations and
Warranties)) and we retain all rights, title, and interests in and to the
Programmes and, except for the limited right of use expressly granted herein,
nothing shall be construed as Yahoo! granting to you any right, title or
interest in or to the Yahoo! Company Sites or Programmes (or any part of them).<br>
<br>
<b><span style='font-weight:bold'>8.CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY.</span></b>&nbsp;
&quot;Confidential Information&quot; means any information of whatever nature,

connection with this Agreement, other than information that you can
establish:&nbsp; (i) was in the public domain prior to disclosure by us (other
than through breach of this Section); or (ii) was in your possession, without
confidentiality restrictions, prior to disclosure by us.&nbsp; You shall not at
any time:&nbsp; (a) disclose or otherwise make available to any person or
entity any Confidential Information (other than to your employees and
Authorised Users who are bound in writing by use and confidentiality
restrictions which are no less protective than the provisions of this Agreement
and who have a need to know such Confidential Information in connection with
the Agreement); or (b) access, use, or copy any Confidential Information,
except as strictly necessary in connection with the purpose for which such
Confidential Information is disclosed to you and in accordance with the
Agreement. <br>

(a) you notify us promptly prior to such disclosure; (b) at our request, you
assist us in obtaining an order protecting the Confidential Information from

necessary to comply with the legal requirement.&nbsp; All Confidential

uninstalled or destroyed immediately upon our request or upon termination of
the Agreement. <br>

accordance with our privacy policy at
http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com/en_GB/legal/privacy_y.php (the &quot;Privacy
Policy&quot;); and (ii) for the purposes of providing you with the Yahoo!
Company Sites and Programmes and to administer your account (including

the Agreement, any Programme Terms and any products or services of us or our Affiliates
from time to time), and for the same purposes you agree to our disclosing such
data to other Yahoo! Entities (and the transfer of that data to countries which
may not afford the same level of protection of such data as the countries in
which you initially access the Yahoo! Company Sites or Programmes).<br>
<br>
You must not, and must ensure that any person acting on your behalf does not,
issue any press release or other public statement (or any statement which is
likely to be made public) relating to the Agreement or any part of it without
our prior written consent.<br>

BUDGETING AND ADVERTISER MATERIALS DISPLAY PROCESS.</span></b> <b><span
style='font-weight:bold'>SUBMISSION OF ADVERTISER MATERIALS.</span></b>&nbsp;
Unless you choose otherwise at the time you submit Advertiser Materials,&nbsp;
Advertiser Materials may be included by us in each of our products and services
from time to time.&nbsp; If you wish to include Advertiser Materials in
particular products or services, cancel Advertiser Materials or make changes to
your bids or budgeting, you must do so using your Account Management Method, or
other means notified by us to you on request. You may terminate your
participation in this Programme and cancel your Advertiser Materials in any
part of the Distribution Network at any time by providing notice to us in
accordance with Section 15 (Notices) of the Master Terms and Conditions.<br>
You can submit Advertiser Materials, or make changes to existing Advertiser
Materials via those Yahoo! Company Site(s) which allow you to do so , currently
located at
https://login.marketingsolutions.yahoo.com/adui/signin/loadSignin.do?m=1&amp;l=en_GB,
and any associated pages.<br>
You may request that we assist you with the submission of Advertiser Materials,
upon payment of an up-front fee to us for such assistance, as specified by your
Campaign Management Method, in accordance with the payment provisions under the
Agreement.<br>
<br>
<b><span style='font-weight:bold'>BUDGETING.</span></b>&nbsp; In order to
access and use the Sponsored Search Programme for Advertiser Materials you will
be required to pay an up-front initial deposit to us, as specified by your
Campaign Management Method, in accordance with the payment provisions set out
under the Master Terms and Conditions.<br>
You may, using your Campaign Management Method:<br>
a. be required by us from time to time to specify an amount (in whole pounds
sterling) to be put on account for your use of the Sponsored Search Programme
prior to your using the Sponsored Search Programme, which will be paid up-front
to us; and<br>
b. specify that you do not wish us to top-up your account, in which case your
Advertiser Materials will be suspended from the Distribution Network when we
determine that your account has insufficient funds, until such time that you do
top-up your account; or<br>
c. agree that your account will immediately be topped-up by a specific amount
(as specified by you, in whole pounds sterling) if your account contains only
three days' (or less) worth of funds based on your average account spend.<br>
<br>
Amounts to be put on account or to top-up your account are as specified by you
by means of your Campaign Management Method, and are subject to any minimum
amount that we may require.&nbsp; Unless you specify a different top-up amount,
or specify that you do not wish to top-up your account, then the top-up amount
will be the same as the initial amount you placed on account.&nbsp; Your
account may be subject to minimum monthly spend amounts as notified to you by
us on the Yahoo! Company Sites from time to time.<br>
<br>
If you elect to set a budget to apply in relation to relevant words or phrases
then a target monthly budget will be calculated by us in our absolute
discretion based on the amount you have specified.&nbsp; If at any time we
determine that any such target monthly budget may be exceeded, we may suspend
the relevant Advertiser Materials from the Distribution Network for such time
as it deems necessary or desirable for the target monthly budget not to be
exceeded.<br>
<br>
If you choose to set a budget or change that budget then the start date of the
target monthly budget period will be reset as soon as commercially practicable
thereafter.<br>
You may require (in writing) Yahoo! to return to you: (i) any monies on your
account less any fees then payable by you; and (ii) any amount by which your
target monthly budget (if any) has been exceeded by more than 10% except to the
extent that we suspend or terminate your use of the Yahoo! Company Sites, any
Programme or the Agreement or any part of it for any act or omission by or on
behalf of you. This is your sole and exclusive remedy if your target monthly
budget is exceeded. We may close accounts which have been inactive for more
than 24 months. If following such termination, a credit balance remains on your
account, we will use our reasonable endeavours to refund such balance, less any
non-refundable amounts and a reasonable account closing fee. If we are unable
to do so using the contact information we hold, we shall dispose of any balance
pursuant to the Agreement and our policies and procedures.<br>
<br>
The Yahoo! Company Sites or Distribution Network may not be available or your
access to it or your Advertiser Materials suspended if we have not received the
above fees and amounts.<br>
<br>
During the period of any such suspension, relevant Advertiser Materials are
de-listed and the bidding process starts again as if the relevant bid for the
de-listed Advertiser Materials has not been placed.<br>
<br>
You agree that the charges that you shall pay for the Sponsored Search
Programme will include, in addition to any applicable service fees , charges
for all clicks on your Advertiser Materials, subject only to any maximum bid
price and budgeting arrangements as set out above. The charges are in addition
to the fees for any other Programmes.&nbsp; Your Advertiser Materials are
subject to the then-current minimum bid requirements for particular words or
phrases as specified on the Yahoo! Company Sites from time to time.&nbsp;
Unless otherwise agreed in writing by us, the charges will be deducted from the
amount you initially placed on account or the amounts by which your account is
topped-up as envisaged under these Programme Terms.<br>
<br>
You can submit a maximum bid amount that you will pay to us for each click on
the relevant Advertiser Materials displayed in relation to the word or phrase
for the relevant Advertiser Materials.<br>
<br>
If the bids of other advertisers for the same words or phrases relating to
their Advertiser Materials increase then you agree that we may, at our sole
option and taking into account additional factors such as the relevancy of your
Advertiser Materials, automatically increase your bid to a value of £0.01
higher than the then highest bid, without exceeding any maximum bid you have
specified in accordance with these Programme Terms.</span></font></p>

‘click-throughs' and/or other activities, and also including information on how
visitors to your website may disable such monitoring technologies; and (ii)
maintain and adhere to a privacy policy on your website which shall, as a
minimum:&nbsp; (a) be available as a clear and conspicuous link from the main
page of your website and any other website page where visitors may provide
personally identifiable information; and (b) comply with all applicable data

ads in your account(s) and/or adding and removing keywords to your account(s).<br>
Yahoo! identifies those accounts which it considers would benefit from
optimisation and are appropriate for optimisation, and therefore you may find
that some but not others of your accounts are optimised in this way. We will
notify you via email of such changes made to your account(s), and will include
a spreadsheet of such changes upon your written request. If you would like any
of such changes reversed, please reply to such email within 14 days of receipt
and we will reverse the change(s) you specifically identify as soon as
practically possible. Yahoo!'s optimisaton permissions shall not extend to
varying (i) budgets you have set, or (ii) maximum bid prices you have set.<br>
