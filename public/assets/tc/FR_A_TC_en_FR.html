For this purpose, the CUSTOMER undertakes to notify YAHOO&nbsp;! without delay, in writing, of any changes to these elements.</p>

<p>These SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS govern the reservation and sale of advertising space available on <a href="http://www.yahoo.fr">the YAHOO&nbsp;! MEDIA</a> and the PARTNER MEDIA in the framework of the GUARANTEED INVENTORY OFFER, and complete the YAHOO&nbsp;! GTCS (General Terms and Conditions of Sale). Thus, notwithstanding the provisions of the GTCS, the provisions set out in the Special Terms and Conditions: GUARANTEED INVENTORY OFFER, defined below, shall apply. However, in the event of contradiction between GTCS and these terms and conditions, the latter shall prevail.</p>
<p><strong>1. FORMATION OF THE CONTRACT</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.1. General rules</strong> </p>
<p>On receipt of requests for information (also known as brief(s)) from the CUSTOMER with a view to publishing MEDIA ADVERTISEMENTS, and subject to their approval by YAHOO ! (and in particular by its financial department), YAHOO ! shall draw up a PROPOSAL which it will send to the CUSTOMER. The CUSTOMER shall then have a period of 14 business days as of the date appearing in the PROPOSAL to notify YAHOO !, by any means, of its wish to publish its ADVERTISEMENT(S) under those conditions appearing in the PROPOSAL. </p>
<p>The CUSTOMER shall also inform YAHOO&nbsp;! by any means of the sites among <a href="http://www.yahoo.fr">the YAHOO&nbsp;!</a> MEDIA and/or PARTNER MEDIA on which it wishes to publish its MEDIA ADVERTISEMENTS.</p>
<p>Once the PROPOSAL has been notified to YAHOO&nbsp;!, and subject to availability as described in the PROPOSAL, YAHOO&nbsp;! shall then send the CONTRACT which must be signed by the CUSTOMER in compliance with the signature rules laid down by YAHOO&nbsp;! and applicable as of the signature of said CONTRACT, under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As of receipt of the CONTRACT, the CUSTOMER must return it without delay by fax or e-mail if the CUSTOMER has an electronic signature, duly signed and completed and bearing the words “<em>read and approved</em>”; or</li>
  <li>If the CUSTOMER meets the conditions required by YAHOO&nbsp;! for online signature of a CONTRACT (as communicated by YAHOO&nbsp;! on request), the CUSTOMER may then sign the CONTRACT electronically. In order to do so, the CUSTOMER must follow the signature procedure given in the e-mail sent by YAHOO&nbsp;!, and must in particular read and accept these GTCS online, then accept the CONTRACT online. Once accepted, the CONTRACT shall be automatically sent by e-mail to YAHOO&nbsp;!; or</li>
  <li>If the CUSTOMER does not meet the conditions required by YAHOO&nbsp;! for the online signature of a CONTRACT or if it wishes to sign a CONTRACT by hand, the CUSTOMER must i) print the CONTRACT sent by YAHOO&nbsp;! by e-mail, ii) complete and sign it by hand, then iii) return it, signed, to YAHOO&nbsp;! without delay by fax or by e-mail (digitised version).</li>
</ul>
<p>YAHOO&nbsp;! shall inform the CUSTOMER of the signature rules applicable at the time of signature of the CONTRACT by the CUSTOMER.</p>
<p>In the event that all or part of the conditions appearing in the PROPOSAL are no longer available at the time of notification by the CUSTOMER, YAHOO&nbsp;! shall send it a new PROPOSAL which will be subject to the above rules.</p>
<p>The CUSTOMER must then without delay provide the type of file that it will use for its advertising (in a format stated at the URL: http://fr.solutions.yahoo.com/ and with any other format requiring YAHOO&nbsp;!’s prior agreement), together with any documents and/or information required by YAHOO&nbsp;! as the case may be.</p>
<p><strong>1.2. Option rules</strong></p>
<p>The CUSTOMER shall be able to place two options: an “option 1” for a date corresponding to a first choice for the publication of its MEDIA ADVERTISEMENT and providing priority for that date, and an “option 2” corresponding to a second choice of date for publication for which it will not have priority. A same date cannot therefore be the subject of an option 1 and an option 2 by the same CUSTOMER. </p>
<p>If an option is notified to YAHOO&nbsp;! by another advertiser for dates which are already covered by an option 1, those option 1 CUSTOMERS will have a period of two business days following notification sent to them by YAHOO&nbsp;! in order to confirm their option. In the absence of confirmation by the CUSTOMER in the above forms and deadlines, the new advertiser’s option shall necessarily be confirmed.</p>
<p>If a CUSTOMER having notified an option to YAHOO&nbsp;! does not confirm this option within two business days following notification, the CUSTOMER’s option shall no longer have priority if the second advertiser confirms its option by sending YAHOO&nbsp;! the duly signed CONTRACT by any means.</p>
<p>Where the CUSTOMER’s request is made within 10 days preceding the date on which the MEDIA ADVERTISEMENT is effectively put online, the option system described herein shall not be implemented. The CUSTOMER must then directly send YAHOO&nbsp;! the duly signed CONTRACT as of receipt of the PROPOSAL, so that its MEDIA ADVERTISEMENT shall be firmly and definitively reserved.</p>
<p>If an option is proposed more than 10 days prior to the publication date but not finally confirmed 10 days prior to the publication date, the option shall lapse. The first advertiser to send its duly signed CONTRACT to YAHOO&nbsp;! shall then have the slot allotted to it under the desired conditions.</p>
<p><strong>1.3. Special rules applicable to MEDIA ADVERTISEMENTS published on the Home Page</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>1.3.1</u></strong><u> On YAHOO&nbsp;! MEDIA</u></p>

  <li>If the CUSTOMER’s request is made within 10 days prior to the MEDIA ADVERTISEMENT being effectively put online on the Home Page, the option system described in point 1.1 above shall not be implemented.

<p>YAHOO&nbsp;! shall send a firm offer stating the publication period of the ADVERTISEMENT and reminding the CUSTOMER that the days and placement for publication shall be chosen at its discretion.

<p><u>• An overall maximum budget for the entire duration of its advertising campaigns as specified in the CONTRACT.</u> YAHOO&nbsp;! may, as of the time the budget amount has been reached, suspend publication of the SEARCH ADVERTISEMENT, even where prior to the end of the campaign. Its account shall then be inactive. The CUSTOMER may verify the number of days of publication remaining on its account and send YAHOO&nbsp;!, as necessary, a renewal INSERTION ORDER so that its SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS will be once again published on the SEARCH MEDIA (hereinafter a “Renewal Order”).</p>
<p>• <u>A maximum monthly budget without limit in duration</u>.

The CUSTOMER’s account shall be inactive for the duration of the suspension.</p>
<p><strong> 4. PAYMENT TERMS</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.1.</strong> The CUSTOMER undertakes to pay YAHOO&nbsp;!, in Euros, the amount marked as debit on its account plus any applicable taxes, in compliance with the applicable payment terms and/or payment plans, and with the invoicing conditions in force. </p>
<p><strong>4.2</strong>. <u>For AC CUSTOMERS</u>: payments shall be made monthly, by cheque or by wire transfer (costs to be borne by the CUSTOMER), within 30 days from the date of invoice for AC CUSTOMERS using SEARCH MARKETING OFFERS directly with YAHOO&nbsp;!, or within 60 days from the date of invoice for paying INTERMEDIARIES using SEARCH MARKETING OFFERS in the name and on behalf of a AM CUSTOMER. </p>
<p><strong>4.3. </strong><u>For OLS CUSTOMERS</u>: payments shall be made by credit card (costs to be borne by the CUSTOMER), according to the continuous traffic plan. A direct debit shall be made from the OLS CUSTOMER’s bank account whenever its YAHOO&nbsp;! account has a balance equal to only 3 days of remaining traffic.<br>

Its invoices will be available in the online account management tool. </p>
<p><strong>5. RULES ON PUBLICATION, DISPLAY AND POSITIONING OF THE ADVERTISEMENTS </strong> </p>
<p><strong>5.1  PUBLICATION RULES</strong> </p>
<p>5.1.1. The CUSTOMER acknowledges and accepts that its SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS shall be published, without distinction, in advertising space on one or more of the SEARCH MEDIA subject to the display and positioning rules set out below, without being able to choose any one of the SEARCH MEDIA.</p>
<p>5.1.2. The CUSTOMER may however use the “Domain Blocking” function via the online account management tool available at http://marketingsolutions.yahoo.com/fr_FR</p>
<p>This function enables the CUSTOMER to list up to 250 domain names or subdomain names of its choosing for which the publication of the SEARCH ADVERTISEMENT shall be blocked. This function does not permit SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS to be blocked for YAHOO&nbsp;! MEDIA domain names and subdomain names or any site operated by one of the YAHOO ! ENTITIES. </p>
<p>The CUSTOMER may use this function and modify the list at any time over the performance of its CONTRACT. The blocking of these listed domain names and subdomain names shall be effective within a maximum time of 48 hours following confirmation of their entry via the online account management tool.</p>
<p>It is specified that no information concerning the domain names and subdomain names which are part of the SEARCH MEDIA shall be communicated to CUSTOMERS.</p>
<p>5.1.3. The CUSTOMER also acknowledges that for commercial reasons, maintenance, updating or for technical improvements during the publication of its SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS, the sites which are included in the SEARCH MEDIA may change. The CUSTOMER accepts the consequences thereof, including the fact of appearing on any new SEARCH MEDIUM and disappearing from any former SEARCH MEDIUM, throughout the publication of its SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS, without any claim being possible seeking the liability of YAHOO&nbsp;! or any YAHOO&nbsp;! ENTITY in this respect.</p>
<p><strong>5.2.  DISPLAY RULES</strong></p>
<p>5.2.1. The rules for the display of the SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS may vary according to the SEARCH MEDIA.</p>
<p>5.2.2. Two display options are available via the online management tool:</p>
<p>- “Exact” targeting: the SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS are displayed on all or part of the SEARCH MEDIA, strictly according to the entered KEYWORD(S);</p>
<p>- “Advanced” targeting: the SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS are displayed on all or part of the SEARCH MEDIA according to the entered KEYWORD(S) or a group of words containing the KEYWORD. Thus, for example, and without this limiting the foregoing, if the CUSTOMER selects the KEYWORDS “buy books”, its SEARCH ADVERTISEMENT will appear in response to the works “buy books” or “buy books second-hand” entered by a user. It is specified that the CUSTOMER has the possibility, in the context of advanced targeting, to exclude KEYWORDS including the trademarks of one of its competitors, in order to ensure that its SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS are not displayed when a user enters said KEYWORDS.</p>
<p>5.2.3. The default rotation of the SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS within a GROUP of SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS is calculated according to the performance of the SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS within a given GROUP of ADVERTISEMENTS. The CUSTOMER may however select a rotation in the online account management tool applying an egalitarian method among its SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS within a given GROUP. </p>
<p><strong>5.3.  POSITIONING RULES</strong> </p>
<p>5.3.1. YAHOO&nbsp;! compares the amount of the CUSTOMER’s MAXIMUM BID for the KEYWORD that it has chosen with all of the MAXIMUM BIDS by other advertisers for this same KEYWORD. YAHOO&nbsp;! constantly adjusts the CUSTOMER’s COST PER CLICK according to the MAXIMUM BIDS by other advertisers, without ever exceeding its MAXIMUM BID.</p>
<p>The positioning of the SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS on the SEARCH MEDIA therefore depends on the amounts of the CUSTOMER’s MAXIMUM BIDS and those of other advertiser for one or more identical KEYWORDS, and the quality index value of its SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS (and in particular the pertinence and click rate on its SEARCH ADVERTISEMENT).</p>
<p><strong>5.3.2.</strong> Moreover, the CUSTOMER acknowledges and accepts that:</p>
<p>(i) YAHOO&nbsp;! does not guarantee that its SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS or GROUPS of SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS shall be displayed on the SEARCH MEDIA or that they will appear with a given position or rank; </p>
<p>(ii) another advertiser may set a MAXIMUM BID for the same KEYWORD(S) for which the CUSTOMER has already set a MAXIMUM BID; </p>
<p>(iii) its SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS cannot be displayed on the SEARCH MEDIA if, for a given KEYWORD, there are more advertisers or SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS than there are available positions in the advertising space for said SEARCH MEDIA; </p>
<p>(iv) its SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS may be published in a shortened or truncated form, and their size and format may be modified, for all or part of the SEARCH MEDIA, in order to have its ADVERTISEMENTS comply with the display and technical rules of the SEARCH MEDIA; </p>
<p>(vi) YAHOO&nbsp;! does not guarantee, and cannot guarantee, the time of delivery of impressions and clicks on the SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS, nor the clicks on SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS, nor the number of impressions, number of conversions clicks to sales (or otherwise), and generally the quality of traffic on the advertiser’s site as generated from the SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS.</p>
<p><strong>6. “CAMPAIGN OPTIMISATION” TOOL</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Campaign Optimisation&quot; tool allows the CUSTOMER to optimise its budget according to the objectives of its activity (for example, attaining a certain cost per click or a certain return on advertising investment) or its specific demands (the value and scale of impressions, clicks and conversions/revenues). The conditions for subscription to this service are available from YAHOO ! on request. </p>
<p><strong>7. “ANALYSES” TOOL </strong></p>
<p>This tool offers the “Conversion Only” service and the “Full Analytics” service, and makes it possible to obtain the following information: direct and indirect conversions of clicks into actions defined by the CUSTOMER (including sales), turnover generated thanks to clicks on the SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS, the cost per acquisition, and the return on investment.</p>
<p>The conditions for subscription to these services shall be communicated by YAHOO&nbsp;! on request. </p>
<p>If the CUSTOMER is eligible and subscribes to the “Conversion only” service, YAHOO&nbsp;! may, on its request, provide html code (a “tracking” markup tag) available via the online account management tool under the “Analyses” subheading of the “Administration” menu, for integration into the conversion page on its website. </p>
<p>If the CUSTOMER is eligible and subscribes to the “Full Analytics” service, YAHOO&nbsp;! may, on its request, provide html code for integration into each of the pages of its websites, and for this tool to be available in its account. </p>
<p>Subscription to the Conversion only and Full Analytics services causes the installation of a cookie in the browsers of web users who visit the CUSTOMER’s site. </p>
<p>In the framework of the CONTRACT, YAHOO&nbsp;! grants the CUSTOMER a non-exclusive, revocable and non-transferable user licence, which cannot be sublicensed, for the purposes of using its account associated with the SEARCH MARKETING OFFERS, for the duration of the CONTRACT, in order to use, execute and implement the html code, solely for the purposes defined above. </p>
<p>The CUSTOMER accepts that throughout the process of putting the “Conversion only” and “Full Analytics” services into place, YAHOO&nbsp;! can add certain parameters to the URL associated with its SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS. The CUSTOMER accepts not to edit or delete these parameters, insofar as that may prevent the normal functioning of these services and could have the effect of impairing and distorting the results.</p>
<p><strong>8. HTML CODE</strong></p>
<p>At any time while the analytic tools or the html code are integrated in the CUSTOMER’s website(s), the CUSTOMER accepts to: </p>
<p>(i) obtain all rights and authorisations required so that the YAHOO&nbsp;! ENTITIES may use the analytic data under the conditions set out in the Contract and in the YAHOO&nbsp;! Privacy Policy available at the following address: <a href="http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com/fr_FR/legal/privacy_y.php">http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com/fr_FR/legal/privacy_y.php</a> which includes the use of cookies, markup tags and/or any other tracking technology with the aim of compiling anonymous statistics concerning the visitors to its website(s) and to monitor certain pages on its website in order to make a report on the traffic, statistics and clicks on the SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS and/or other activities, including any and all information on the manner in which the users of its site(s) may deactivate such monitoring technologies, and </p>
<p>(ii) provide the conditions for the use of its users’ personal data on its website. This privacy policy must at least: </p>
<p>(a) be available by clicking on a visible and legible link on the main page of its website(s) and on any other page on which the users of its website(s) may be induced to provide personal data,</p>
<p>(b) comply in all manners with applicable laws concerning the protection of personal data, and in particular to inform final users and guarantee that the processing of any personal data is justified. The necessary and appropriate rights, consent and authorisations must be obtained so that YAHOO&nbsp;! may use this data under those conditions provided for in its Privacy Policy, in the General Terms and Conditions and in the Terms and Conditions of Use of the SEARCH MARKETING OFFERS. </p>
<p><strong>9. API ACCESS</strong></p>
<p>The CUSTOMER may use the data made available to it in the framework of a SEARCH MARKETING OFFER and in the online account management tool, for purely internal use within its entity in order to manage its accounts and campaigns, subject to concluding a written contract with YAHOO&nbsp;! for payment to the latter of the price of this service as determined by mutual agreement with YAHOO&nbsp;!, and the use of API Access and Code in accordance with the provisions of this Article. It is expressly agreed that the CUSTOMER may not publish these data. </p>
<p>“<strong>API Access”</strong> is the possibility, via the API Code, to access certain data in order to use them on the internal network, and send orders on behalf of the CUSTOMER to whom API Access is associated. The CUSTOMER cannot use its API Access, or any data obtained therefrom, for purposes other than the management of its accounts for the SEARCH MARKETING OFFERS to which the API Access is associated. YAHOO&nbsp;! may limit, modify or terminate the CUSTOMER’s API Access under those conditions defined in the agreement concluded by and between YAHOO&nbsp;! and the CUSTOMER. Such modifications and/or limitations may require the modification, at the CUSTOMER’s expense, of the API Code in order to ensure the continuity of API Access. </p>
<p>The term “<strong>API Code”</strong> refers to software enabling API Access created by the CUSTOMER or YAHOO&nbsp;! and which uses an XLM/SOAP interface which will be specified by YAHOO&nbsp;!. If YAHOO&nbsp;! provides API Code or software for integration in the API Code developed by the CUSTOMER, YAHOO&nbsp;! shall then grant, subject to the terms and conditions of an agreement, a non-exclusive, revocable and non-transferable user licence, which cannot be sublicensed, for the sole purposes of using the API Access, and limited to internal usage by the CUSTOMER’s entity. This licence is granted until the end of the Contract as defined in Article 3.1 of the GTCS. The CUSTOMER undertakes to allow YAHOO&nbsp;! to access the API Code for verification, on mere request, and to notify YAHOO&nbsp;! of all characteristics and functions of the API Code and the application to which the API Code is associated. Use of the API Code must not create an unreasonable or disproportionate load on the systems of YAHOO&nbsp;!, according to its standards. </p>
<p><strong>10. USE OF THE SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS</strong> </p>
<p>For the purposes hereof and in order to be able to use one or more SEARCH MARKETING OFFERS, the CUSTOMER hereby grants to YAHOO&nbsp;!, to the YAHOO&nbsp;! ENTITIES and to the SEARCH MEDIA, throughout the duration of the CONTRACT, on a non-exclusive and gratuitous basis, and for the whole world, the irrevocable right to: </p>
<p>(i) access, display, use, reproduce, copy, represent and communicate all or part of its website(s) and/or its SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS, and/or its GROUP of SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS, and/or generally its elements which comprise the same, by any means, and/or to modify, adapt, reformat, recompile, disassemble, decompile, manipulate, translate into any language or languages, all or part of its website(s)and/or SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS, and/or GROUP of SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS, and to distribute the same. These rights are granted for all media as may be known now or in the future, including all physical media, optical, magnetic, analogue, digital, and electronic media, including media such as paper, magnetic tape, floppy disk, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, hard disk, computers and servers, the Internet, all private or public telecommunications networks, by cable, satellite, radio wave, etc. This grant of intellectual property rights shall not give rise to any duty for the YAHOO ! ENTITIES to exploit the rights thereby granted; </p>
<p>(ii) access, catalogue, store in memory, and present the website(s) to which the CUSTOMER’s SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS direct, or any part of these sites, by any means including the use of robots and/or spiders, and to</p>
<p>(iii) create and display copies of any text, image, graphic, audio or video element on the websites to which the CUSTOMER’s SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS direct or elsewhere, or extract information from the appropriate website or URL, and use this information in order to analyser the content thereof and any appropriate words or expressions. </p>
<p>The software and hardware, underlying systems and technologies, and any other data, information and content found on or created, collected, processed, compiled, analysed or derived (including details concerning accounts, summary information, reports, results or data) used by the YAHOO&nbsp;! MEDIA, the SEARCH MARKETING OFFERS and any site of any YAHOO&nbsp;! ENTITY or SEARCH MEDIA (including any intellectual property rights or any other form of property throughout the world), are the property of YAHOO&nbsp;! or its licensors. In the event that the CUSTOMER becomes the holder of such rights, it undertakes to transfer them fully and without conditions and without remuneration to YAHOO&nbsp;!.</p>
<p>YAHOO&nbsp;! is the holder of rights in the SEARCH MARKETING OFFERS which are protected by intellectual property laws in force. YAHOO&nbsp;! therefore reserves all rights, titles and interests in the SEARCH MARKETING OFFERS and, subject to the limited right of use which is expressly granted to the CUSTOMER by these terms and conditions, nothing may be construed as an assignment or transfer by YAHOO&nbsp;! to the CUSTOMER or any rights, titles or interests in YAHOO&nbsp;!’s SEARCH MARKETING OFFERS (or any part of them) or the rights in any patent, commercial secret or other intellectual property rights of YAHOO&nbsp;!. </p>
<p><strong>11. TERMINATION / SUSPENSION </strong></p>
<p><strong>11.1</strong> To the exclusion of CONTRACTS which concern the publication of SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS concluded for a given duration (meaning those for which a maximum budget for the publication period has been defined, as specified in Article 3.4 hereof), the CUSTOMER may at any time bring a definitive end to the publication of its SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS, without any reasons being required, by giving notice to YAHOO&nbsp;! that it wishes to deactivate its account and terminate the CONTRACT (as the case may be) according to the terms for notification as set forth in Article 15.4 of the GTCS or directly in the online account management tool. The publication of the SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS shall cease within a maximum period of 3 business days as of receipt of its notification and any sums due shall become immediately payable.</p>

<p><strong>11.3. </strong>YAHOO&nbsp;! may notify the CUSTOMER, according to the terms set forth in Article 15.4 of the GTCS, at any time, without delay and without any indemnity in its favour, and without prejudice to its other rights, of: </p>
