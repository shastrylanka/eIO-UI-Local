	For any Program in which you enroll, you will pay us for all charges
	and fees you incur in connection with each Program in the currency
	indicated by us. Our measurements are the definitive measurements
	under the Agreement and will be used to calculate your charges. If
	you are enrolling in a Program or signing an Insertion Order for the
	first time, you must submit a completed credit application to
	determine the terms of payment. If no credit application is
	submitted or the request for credit is denied by us in our sole
	discretion, the Insertion Order must be paid in advance of the
	advertisement start date. Major credit cards (VISA and M/C) are
	accepted.  If we approve your credit, we will either bill your
	Payment Method for all such charges and fees in connection with each
	Program, or, if we have determined that you may be billed on an
	invoice basis, we will submit an invoice to you at the e-mail or
	mailing address (at our discretion) for your billing contact set out
	in the Insertion Order or as required by applicable law, and you
	will pay such charges in full by the 30th day of the month in which
	the invoice is issued. If we agree to your request to send an
	invoice to a third party on your behalf, such third party will
	timely pay the invoice, and if such party does not pay the invoice,
	you will immediately pay all such amounts. If you enroll in a
	Payment Plan, you will be bound by the Payment Method &amp; Payment
	Plan Program Terms, below, which may be modified by us from time to
	time. If we are unable to receive payment from your Payment Method
	successfully, or if we do not otherwise receive timely payment, you
	will pay all amounts then owing by you to us upon our demand and, in
	addition to other rights, we may terminate any agreement with you.
	Any disputes about charges to your account(s) must be submitted to
	us in writing within 60 days of the date you incurred such charge,
	otherwise you waive such dispute and such charge will be final and
	not subject to challenge. If you fail to make payment as set forth
	herein, you will pay a late fee at the rate of 5% above the 90-day
	bank bill rate of HSBC New Zealand (or the highest amount allowed by
	law if less than 5%) of all past due charges, and all reasonable
	expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees) incurred by us in
	collecting such charges. We reserve the right to suspend performance
	of our obligations hereunder (or under any other agreement with you)
	in the event you fail to make timely payment hereunder or under any
	other agreement with us. Charges and fees do not include any
	applicable sales, use, value-added, withholding, excise, or any
	other taxes or government charges, which are payable by you and are
	in addition to any amounts due to us hereunder. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
