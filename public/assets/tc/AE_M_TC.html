any Program in which you enroll, you agree to pay us for all charges and fees
you incur in connection with each Program in the currency indicated by us. You
agree that our measurements are the definitive measurements under the Agreement
and will be used to calculate your charges. You agree that (i) we may bill your
payment method for all such charges and fees in connection with each Program,
including if you enroll in a payment plan, or alternatively, (ii) if we have
determined that you may be billed on an invoice basis, then we will submit an
invoice to you at the e-mail or mailing address (at our discretion) on the
Insertion Order or as required by applicable law, and you agree to pay such
charges, without offset or deduction, within 60 days of the invoice date. If we
agree to your request to send an invoice to a third party on your behalf, you
agree that such third party will timely pay the invoice, and in the event such
party does not pay the invoice, you are obligated to immediately pay all such
amounts. If you provide us with a payment method and/or enroll in a payment
plan, you agree to be bound by the payment method &amp; payment plan program
terms that we will provide you with. If we are unable to receive payment from
your payment method successfully, or if we do not otherwise receive timely
payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts then owing by you to us upon our
demand and, in addition to other rights, we may suspend performance, remove
your ads, and/or terminate any agreement with you. All payments of service fees,
unused promotional credits, and initial deposit(s) are non-refundable and our
property. You agree to submit any disputes about charges to your account(s) to
us in writing within 60 days of the date you incurred such charge, otherwise
you waive such dispute and such charge will be final and not subject to
challenge. If you fail to make payment as set forth herein, you will pay an
administration fee equal to 1% monthly (or the highest amount allowed by law if
less than 1% monthly) of all past due charges, and all reasonable expenses
(including attorneys’ fees) incurred by us in collecting past due charges.
Charges and fees do not include any applicable bank charges, sales, use, value-
added, withholding, excise, or any other taxes or government charges (exclusive
of our income taxes), which are payable by you and are in addition to any
amounts due to us hereunder. Accounts with no activity for more than 24 months
will be closed by us and will be assessed an account closing fee not to exceed
the lesser of $25 U.S. (or its equivalent) or the balance in the account. If a
balance remains (other than unused promotional credits and initial deposits),
we will attempt to refund any portion of such balance that may be owed to you.
In the event we are unable to refund any such balance using your contact
information on file with us, we will dispose of the balance pursuant to the
Agreement and our policies and procedures.<br>
