Payment Method for all such charges and fees in connection with each
Program or, if we have determined you may be billed on an invoice
basis, we will submit an invoice to you at the e-mail or mailing
address on the Insertion Order or as required by applicable law, and
you will pay all undisputed charges in full within 45 days of the
invoice date.  If we agree to your request to send an invoice to a

charges to your account(s) must be submitted to us in writing within
60 days of the date you incurred such charge, otherwise you waive
such dispute and such charge will be final and not subject to
challenge.  If you fail to make any payment as set forth herein, you
will pay all reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees)
incurred by us in collecting such charges.  Charges and fees do not
include any applicable bank charges, sales, use, value-added,
withholding, excise, or any other taxes or government charges, which

hereunder.  Accounts with no activity for more than 24 months will be
closed by us and will be assessed an account closing fee not to
exceed the lesser of U.S. $25 (or its equivalent) or the balance in
the account. If a balance remains (other than unused promotional

of such balance that may be owed to you. If we are unable to refund
any such balance using your contact information on file with us, we
will dispose of the balance pursuant to the Agreement and our

you and us regarding the subject matter contained herein and

matter contained herein.  No terms or conditions other than those set
forth in these Master Terms and Conditions, any Program Terms, or
Insertion Order(s) will be binding on us unless expressly agreed to
in writing by us.  The terms of any specific Program Terms govern
only that Program, and not any other Program, except as specifically
referenced in such Program Terms.  If there is a conflict between the
Master Terms and Conditions, any Program Terms, and any Insertion
Order, the conflict will be resolved according to the following order
of precedence:  (1)&nbsp;Program Terms, (2) Master Terms and
Conditions, and (3) Insertion Order.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
an Insertion Order may amend the Master Terms and Conditions and/or
the applicable Program Terms only if the amended terms contained in
such Insertion Order:  (i) apply only to the account(s) listed in the
Insertion Order, (ii) apply only to that Insertion Order and not to
any other Program or Insertion Order(s), and (iii) specifically
identify the provision(s) of the Program Terms or the Master Terms
and Conditions they amend.  Only a written instrument specifically
waiving compliance that is executed by whichever of you or us is
entitled to waive such compliance may waive any term(s) and/or
condition(s) of the Agreement.  No waiver by you or us of a breach of
any provision hereof will be deemed a waiver of any other breach of
such provision or a waiver of the provision.  If any provision of the
Agreement is held or made invalid or unenforceable for any reason,
such invalidity will not affect the remainder of the Agreement, and
the invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced by a valid
provision that has a similar economic effect.  Except for your
payment obligations, neither we nor you will have any liability under
the Agreement by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of
our or your obligations on account of strikes, shortages, riots, acts
of terrorism, insurrection, fires, flood, storm, explosions,
earthquakes, Internet and/or electrical outages, computer viruses,
acts of God, war, governmental action, or any cause that is beyond
our or your reasonable control.  You and we are independent
contractors and nothing in the Agreement will be construed to create,

authority to create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of the
other and the Agreement is not intended to benefit, nor will it be
deemed to give rise to any rights in, any third party.

The CPM, CPC or CPA amount for any campaign shall be specified in the
Insertion Order or otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. For
the purposes of calculating CPA campaigns, an action (“Action”)
occurs when a user clicks on or is exposed to your ad on the
Distribution Network and subsequently visits your website within the
negotiated time frame and triggers the delivery of the Conversion
Pixel to the user. The fees payable by you shall be the number of
Actions (if any) multiplied by the CPA and subject to any overall
caps agreed by you and us in writing. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with
such budget caps, however you agree that you will pay for any monthly
fees that exceed any such budget cap. We shall, in our sole
discretion (a) decide the placement, timing, frequency, and number of
ad units or impressions delivered, which in turn may impact the
number of Actions, and (b) calculate the monthly fees based on our
own measurements or those of our third party service providers.  For
dynamically priced campaigns in respect of Performance Ads, your
effective CPM will be determined based on your target goals (e.g.
CPC, CPA, or CPM). You hereby give us the right to adjust the
location of and price for your ads (if any) as long as the overall
effective CPM for your campaign does not exceed any budget caps
agreed by the parties. When you use a Yahoo! pre-approved third party
ad server, which cannot account for dynamic pricing, we will report
total cost to you in order for you to accurately determine your
