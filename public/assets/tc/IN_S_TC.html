			an electronic signature to the IO, establishing a contract. In doing
			so, you agree to accept the Agreement; you also agree that we may

			copy of the IO in non-electronic form at any time by submitting a
			request to us at the address set forth in the IO. <strong>b.</strong>
			You may choose to withdraw your consent to receive the IO in
			electronic form. Withdrawing your consent to receive the IO in
			electronic form does not change your existing obligations to us under
			the IO. Instead, withdrawing your consent simply means that you wish
			to have our relationship with you governed by a non-electronic form
			of the IO. If you wish to withdraw your consent to receive the IO in
			electronic form and to instead enter into a non-electronic form of
			the IO, please send a letter and self-addressed, stamped envelope to
			the address set forth in the IO. We then will send you a

			effective when we mail to you a copy of the non-electronic form of
			IO, at which point our relationship will be governed by the terms of
			such IO. In either instance, the obligations that you incur pursuant
			to the electronic form of the IO, prior to the effective date of the
			withdrawal of your consent, will remain unchanged until they are
			fully discharged by you. <strong>c.</strong> In order to access and
			retain the electronic IO, you must have access to the Internet,
			either directly or through devices that access Web-based content, and
			pay any charges associated with such access. In addition, you must

			you of any changes in the hardware or software requirements needed to
			access and/or retain the IO that create a material risk that you will
			not be able to continue to access and/or retain the electronic IO.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>14. OTHER. </strong> The Agreement constitutes the entire
			agreement and understanding between the parties regarding the subject
			matter contained herein and supersedes all previous and
			contemporaneous agreements, proposals, representations, claims, and
			communications in all forms of media (including all instructions,
			advertisements, messages, and policies), written and oral, regarding
			the subject matter contained herein. The Agreement (whether in
			electronic form or manual) is deemed to have been executed in Gurgaon
			and the stamp duty, registration charges and all other costs relating
			to the Agreement shall be solely borne and paid by you. No terms or
			conditions other than those set forth in these Master Terms and
			Conditions, the applicable Program Terms, or a YSM IO shall be
			binding on us unless expressly agreed to in writing by us. Only a
			written instrument specifically waiving compliance that is executed
			by the party waiving such compliance may waive the terms or
			conditions of the Agreement. No waiver by a party of a breach of any
			provision hereof shall be a waiver of any succeeding breach of such
			provision or a waiver of the provision itself. If any provision of
			the Agreement is held or made invalid or unenforceable for any
			reason, such invalidity shall not affect the remainder of the
			Agreement, and the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be
			replaced by a valid provision that comes closest to the original
			intentions of the parties and has a similar economic effect. We shall
			have no liability under the Agreement by reason of any failure or
			delay in the performance of our obligations on account of strikes,
			riots, acts of terrorism, insurrection, fires, flood, storm,
			explosions, earthquakes, internet outages, computer viruses, acts of
			God, war, governmental action, or any other cause that is beyond our
			reasonable control. The parties are independent contractors and
			nothing in the Agreement shall be construed to create, evidence, or
			imply any agency, employment, partnership, or joint venture between
			the parties. Except as otherwise set forth in the Agreement, no party
			shall have any right, power, or authority to create any obligation or
			responsibility on behalf of the other and the Agreement is not
			intended to benefit, nor shall it be deemed to give rise to, any
			rights in any third party. You will not assign, sublicense, or
			transfer the Agreement or any right or duty under the Agreement. Any
			assignment, transfer, or attempted assignment or transfer in
			violation of this Section shall be void and of no force or effect. We
			and our subsequent assignees may assign the Agreement, in whole or in
			part, or assign any of our rights, or delegate any of our duties
			under the Agreement to any party. The Programs are proprietary to us
			and are protected by the applicable intellectual property laws and we
			retain all rights, title, and interests in the Programs. Any rights
			not expressly granted in the Agreement are reserved by us, and all
			implied licenses are disclaimed. Headings used in the Agreement are
			for reference purposes only and in no way affect the Agreement. The
			term &#8220;including&#8221; is a term of enlargement meaning
			&#8220;including without limitation,&#8221; and does not denote
			exclusivity. This Agreement may only be amended by a written
			agreement executed by an authorized representative of each party.
			Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain details of the IO may be
			modified through an e-mail exchange whereby one party sets forth
			proposed new terms and the other party confirms such terms (an <strong>"Email
				Modification"</strong>), provided however that an Email Modification: (a)
			must specify the correct IO number, (b) may encompass changes only to
			the Cap Type and the Cap Amount (as applicable) in that IO, and (c)
			shall not take effect until we have processed the amendments.
			Further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
			Agreement, we may change the Master Terms and Conditions, including
			the Program Terms and the Privacy Policy, at any time by posting a
			notice of such change on the YSM Websites or by notifying you via
			e-mail. Any use by you or Authorized Users, of any Program, YSM
			system or YSM Website after the amendment shall be deemed to be
			continued acceptance by you of the Agreement and the Privacy Policy,
			including any amendments and modifications thereto. You understand
			and agree that services and/or obligations to be performed hereunder
			by us may be performed by our Affiliates, and/or third party service
			provider(s). Terms used but not defined herein shall have the
			meanings given to such terms in the IO or applicable Program Terms.
			Terms used in any Program Terms but not defined therein shall have
			the meanings given to such terms in these Master Terms and
			Conditions. If there is any conflict between the Master Terms and
			Conditions and Program Terms, the Program Terms shall control.

			search engine marketer, reseller, or other entity representing

			who execute an IO for a Program, together with Advertisers. &#8220;<strong>Advertisers</strong>&#8221;

			shall be deemed, in addition to an Agency, an Advertiser if it
			enrolls itself in any Program. <strong>a. </strong>Agency represents,
			warrants, and covenants that: (i) it is the authorized agent of the
			Advertiser and has the legal authority to enter into the Agreement on
			behalf of the Advertiser, make all decisions, and take all actions
			(including adding, deleting, editing, and creating Information, and

			Advertiser&#8217;s accounts; (ii) by Agency executing an IO or
			otherwise enrolling an Advertiser in a Program, the Advertiser is
			also entering into the Agreement; (iii) Agency will not, without our
			prior written consent: (a) make any representation, guarantee, or
			warranty concerning any Program or YSM Entity, including that Agency

			or potential Advertiser regarding any Program, (c) negotiate any
			terms or conditions related to the Programs which may affect the
			rights, protections, and/or obligations of a YSM Entity, and/or that

			perform its duties pursuant to the Agreement in a professional manner
			consistent with the requirements established by us. You will

			claims, whether actual or alleged, that arise out of or in connection
			with any breach of your representations, warranties and undertakings
			under this Section. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall
			affect the obligations of the Advertiser under the IO, which shall
			continue to bind the Advertiser, who shall be deemed to have duly
			executed the IO through you. Upon our request, will immediately
			deliver to us each agreement that designates Agency as the
			Advertiser&#8217;s agent and authorizes Agency to act on the
			Advertiser&#8217;s behalf in connection with the Agreement. In the
			event of termination of the Agreement, Agency agrees that each
			Advertiser may use the keywords, titles, and descriptions of their
			ads. Agency shall not at any time use data or information received in
			connection with the Agreement to conduct any marketing efforts
			targeted at our existing advertisers. While the Agreement is
			effective and for twelve (12) months thereafter, Agency shall not,
			directly or indirectly, contact, refer, or solicit our employees,
			consultants, or agents. <strong>b. Payment Liability. </strong>Without
			limiting any other provision of the Agreement, Agency and each
			Advertiser shall be jointly and severally liable for all payment
			obligations pursuant to Section 2 of these Master Terms and
			Conditions, and you hereby waive any Law that may require us to
			proceed against one or more of you prior to proceeding against any
			others who may also be liable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Agency
			shall be obligated to promptly pay all such amounts due to us
			regardless of whether it has received payment from such Advertiser.
			You acknowledge that we may directly contact any Advertiser
			represented by Agency, including if we have not received payment for
			such Advertiser&#8217;s account within 60 days from the date of the
			applicable invoice.

			<strong>ANALYTICS PROGRAM TERMS</strong> &#8211; If you participate

			Program Terms apply, and are governed by the Master Terms and
			Conditions, above.

			<strong>1. USE</strong> . We may provide you with Analytics in
			connection with a Program(s) for your use (&#8220;<strong>Analytics
				Program</strong>&#8221;). &#8220; <strong>Analytics</strong>&#8221; is Yahoo!
			Code for insertion on your webpages to enable the analytical tools
			available for your account. Provided that you install Analytics,
			Yahoo! Code will be delivered into the Internet browser of visitors
			to your website(s) during their interaction with your website(s).

			revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited, internal-use
			license for use with your Program account to use, execute, and
			display Analytics on your website. During the Analytics set-up
			process, we may append certain parameters to the URL associated with
			your ad to enable the Analytics Program. You may not edit or delete
			such parameters, which would prevent the proper functioning of
			Analytics and would render impaired or inaccurate results. In
			connection with the Analytics Program, you may not, directly or
			indirectly, transmit to a YSM Entity any PII of the visitors to your
			website(s).
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>2. YOUR WEBSITE.</strong> While Analytics is on your
			website(s), you will: (i) obtain all rights and permissions necessary
			for the YSM! Entities to use the Analytics data, including
			statistical and traffic information collected by us and/or provided
			by you, as contemplated under the Agreement, and (ii) maintain and
			adhere to a privacy policy on your website(s) which must, at a
			minimum: (a) be available as a clear and conspicuous link from the
			main page of your website(s) and any other website page where
			visitors may provide PII, (b) comply with all applicable Laws, and
			(c) contain language materially similar to the following:
		</p>
		<p>
			<em> &#8220;We have contracted with Yahoo! to monitor certain
				pages of our website for the purpose of reporting web traffic,
				statistics, advertisement &#8216;click-throughs,&#8217; and/or other
				activities on our website. No personally identifiable data is

			</a> <em>.&#8221; </em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>3. EFFECTS OF TERMINATION.</strong> Upon termination of these
			Analytics Program Terms or the Program Terms of the Program for which
			you have been provided Analytics, (i) you must promptly remove or
