If you wish to include Advertiser Materials in particular products or services, or modify the budget dedicated to the Programme, this will be possible upon specific request to Yahoo! And subject to relevant approval in writing released by Yahoo!. Such modification shall never be automatic, while each single modification shall be submitted via those Yahoo! Company Site(s) which allow you to do so , currently located at <a href="https://login.marketingsolutions.yahoo.com/adui/signin/loadSignin.do?m=6&amp;l=it_IT.">https://login.marketingsolutions.yahoo.com/adui/signin/loadSignin.do?m=6&amp;l=it_IT.</a> You may request Yahoo! assists you with the submission of Advertiser Materials, upon payment of an up-front fee to us for such assistance in accordance with the payment provisions under the Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>BUDGETING.</strong>  In order to access and use the Sponsored Search Programme for Advertiser Materials you will be required to pay an up-front initial deposit to Yahoo!, as specified on the Yahoo! Websites or, whereas applicable, in the Insertion Order, in accordance with the payment provisions set out under the Master Terms and Conditions (“<strong>Available Fund</strong>”). The correct processing of the Programme is subject to the maintenance of a sufficient Available Fund on your account. </p>
<p>As specified on the Yahoo! Websites or, whereas applicable, within the Insertion Order:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>You will be required to pay the amount of the up-front initial deposit to be put on account as Available Fund for your use of the Sponsored Search Programme prior to your using the Sponsored Search Programme; and<br>
    <li>In case there will not be any sufficient Avaialble Fund on your account, your Advertiser Materials will be suspended from the Distribution Network, until such time that you do top-up your account; and</li>
  <li>Yahoo! Shall be entitled to require you to top-up the Available fund on your account if your account contains only three days’ (or less) worth of funds based on your average account spend.
    <p>.Amounts to be put as Available Fund in your account or to top-up your account are as specified by you on the Yahoo! Websites or, whereas applicable, the Insertion Order, and are subject to any minimum amount that we may require.  Unless you specify a different minimum Available Fund, or specify that you do not wish to top-up the Available Fund on your account, then the Available Fund will be the same as the initial amount you placed on account.  Your account may be subject to minimum monthly spend amounts as notified to you by us on the Yahoo! Company Sites or, whereas applicable, on the Insertion Order from time to time</p>
      <p>If you elect to set a budget to apply in relation to relevant words or phrases then a target monthly budget will be calculated by us in Yahoo! absolute discretion based on the amount you have specified.  If at any time Yahoo! determines that any such target monthly budget may be exceeded, Yahoo! may suspend the relevant Advertiser Materials from the Distribution Network for such time as it deems necessary or desirable for the target monthly budget not to be exceeded.</p>
      <p>You may require (in writing) Yahoo! to return to you: (i) any monies on your account less any fees then payable by you; and (ii) any amount by which your target monthly budget (if any), as provided by art. 2 of the Master Terms and conditions (Payment), has been exceeded by more than 10% except to the extent that Yahoo! suspends or terminates your use of the Yahoo! Company Sites, any Programme or the Agreement or any part of it for any act or omission by or on behalf of you. This is your sole and exclusive remedy if your target monthly budget is exceeded.  If following such termination, a credit balance remains on your account, Yahoo! will use any reasonable endeavours to refund such balance, less any non-refundable amounts and a reasonable account closing fee. Should Yahoo! be unable to do so using the contact information hold, Yahoo! shall dispose of any balance pursuant to the Agreement and any company policies and procedures. Unless any contrary provision agreed upon the parties in writing occurs, Yahoo! shall dispose of the Available Fund in your account.</p>
  <p>You agree that the charges that you shall pay for the Sponsored Search and Content Match Programmes will include, in addition to any applicable service fees, charges for all clicks on your Advertiser Materials, subject only to any maximum bid price and budgeting arrangements as set out above. The charges are in addition to the fees for any other Programmes.

Unless otherwise agreed in writing by us, the charges will be deducted from the amount you initially placed as Available Fund under these Programme Terms.</p>
<p>  You can submit a maximum bid amount that you will pay to us for each click on the relevant Advertiser Materials displayed in relation to the word or phrase for the relevant Advertiser Materials. </p>
<p>  If the bids of other advertisers for the same words or phrases relating to their Advertiser Materials increase then you agree that we may, at our sole option and taking into account additional factors such as the relevancy of your Advertiser Materials, automatically increase your bid to a value of £0.01 higher than the then highest bid, without exceeding any maximum bid you have specified in accordance with these Programme Terms. Such a choice, as operated unilaterally by Yahoo!, shall be made at Yahoo! sole discretion and shall be based on several factors as the relevance of your Advertising Material and other objective evaluation criteria. </p></li>
</ol>
  <p><strong>ADVERTISER MATERIALS DISPLAY PROCESS. </strong></p>
  <p>
Yahoo! will compare your bid amount for the relevant word or phrase relating to the Advertiser Materials against all other advertisers bidding on that word or phrase for their own Advertiser Materials.  Yahoo! will determine in its absolute discretion the position in which your Advertiser Materials will appear on the basis of certain criteria which may include, but are not limited to, the relevancy of your Advertiser Materials and your bid amount.</p>
  <p>
    You acknowledge and agree that (i) all advertisers may bid on any key word or phrase (including trade marks) in accordance with our policies; and (ii) your Advertiser Materials may not be displayed if, for a given word or phrase, there are less available display positions than advertisers bidding.
