If a balance remains (other than unused promotional credits and initial deposits), we will attempt to refund any portion of such balance that may be owed to you.

No terms or conditions other than those set forth in these Master Terms and Conditions, any Program Terms or Insertion Order(s) will be binding on us unless expressly agreed to in writing by us.  The terms of any specific Program Terms govern only that Program, and not any other Program, except as specifically referenced in such Program Terms.  If there is a conflict between the Master Terms and Conditions, any Program Terms, and any Insertion Order, the conflict will be resolved according to the following order of precedence:  (1) Program Terms, (2) Master Terms and Conditions, and (3) Insertion Order.

Only a written instrument specifically waiving compliance that is executed by whichever of you or us is entitled to waive such compliance may waive any term(s) and/or condition(s) of the Agreement.  No waiver by you or us of a breach of any provision hereof will be deemed a waiver of any other breach of such provision or a waiver of the provision itself.  If any provision of the Agreement is held or made invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such invalidity will not affect the remainder of the Agreement, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced by a valid provision that has a similar economic effect.

You and we are independent contractors and nothing in the Agreement will be construed to create, evidence, or imply any agency, employment, partnership, or joint venture between you and us.  Except as otherwise set forth in the Agreement, neither you nor we will have any right, power, or authority to create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of the other and the Agreement is not intended to benefit, nor will it be deemed to give rise to any rights in, any third party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that the Yahoo! Companies will be third-party beneficiaries to the Agreement and will be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision in the Agreement which confers a benefit on, or rights in favor of, them.  You may not assign, sublicense, or transfer the Agreement or any right or duty under the Agreement.  Any assignment, transfer, or attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this Section 14 will be void and of no force or effect.  We and our subsequent assignees may assign, delegate, sublicense, or otherwise transfer from time to time the Agreement, or the rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to any person or entity such as to our Affiliate(s).

Any rights not expressly granted in the Agreement are reserved by us, and all implied licenses are disclaimed.  Headings used in the Agreement are for reference purposes only.  As used in the Agreement, the word “including” is a term of enlargement meaning “including without limitation” and does not denote exclusivity, and the words “will,” “shall,” and “must” are deemed to be equivalent and denote a mandatory obligation or prohibition, as applicable.  We may change the Agreement and/or a Privacy Policy at any time by posting such on the applicable Yahoo! Company Website or by email, and such revised Agreement and/or Privacy Policy will supersede and replace the earlier Agreement and/or Privacy Policy.  Any use by you or Authorized Users of any Program after such notice will be deemed to be acceptance by you of the revised Agreement and/or Privacy Policy.  Services and obligations to be performed by us hereunder may be performed by other Yahoo! Companies and/or third-party service providers. </p></li> <li><p><span style="font-weight:bold">REPRESENTATIVE.</span>  If you are an advertising agency, search engine marketer, reseller, or other entity representing Advertisers (“<span style="font-weight:bold">Representative</span>”), this Section applies, and in such case, “<span style="font-weight:bold">you</span>” and “<span style="font-weight:bold">your</span>” mean Representative, any Affiliates of Representative who execute an Insertion Order, together with Advertisers.  “<span style="font-weight:bold">Advertiser</span>” means an entity (including a sole proprietor) which is/will be enrolled in a Program by you.  <span style="font-weight:bold">a.</span> Representative represents, warrants, and covenants that:  (i) it is the authorized agent of the Advertiser and has the legal authority to enter into the Agreement on behalf of the Advertiser, make all decisions, and take all actions relating to the Advertiser’s accounts, (ii) by Representative executing an Insertion Order or otherwise enrolling an Advertiser in a Program, the Advertiser is also entering into the Agreement, (iii) Representative will not, without our prior written consent:  (a) make any representation, guarantee, condition, or warranty concerning any Program or Yahoo!

The types of Payment Methods that we accept and the timing of the billing of the charges and fees may vary according to the Program and country; however, we do not knowingly accept debit cards and you should not provide a debit card as a form of payment.

You authorize us to retain your Payment Method information until such time as you revoke this authorization in accordance with procedures prescribed by us.

Unless and until you or we discontinue your enrollment in a payment plan (“<span style="font-weight:bold">Payment Plan</span>”), your preauthorization for billing your Payment Method is valid until the termination of the Agreement or the discontinuation of the Payment Plan by us or your participation therein.  We will send a notification to the e-mail address associated with your Program account(s) after each preauthorized transaction to notify you that your account(s) has been replenished and your charges and fees have been paid.  Such payments should appear on the periodic statement sent to you by the provider of your Payment Method.  We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or terminate your right to prepay, any Payment Plan, and/or your participation therein at any time.

Your Payment Method will automatically be billed with the preauthorized amount whenever your account has fewer than approximately the prior three (3) days’ worth of charges remaining, as determined by us.  The preauthorized amount then will be credited to your account and, after any debit balance that you may have incurred for charges in excess of the amount you have preauthorized is first deducted, the balance will be available to pay for future charges and fees; thus, while the amount charged to your Payment Method will remain the same throughout the term of your participation in the Non-Stop Traffic Payment Plan, the amount actually available in your account to pay for future charges and fees will vary depending upon the charges and fees you have incurred.  “<span style="font-weight:bold">Fixed Budget Payment Plan</span>”:  Under the Fixed Budget Payment Plan, you determine a monthly amount for charges to your Program account(s) and you preauthorize us to bill your Payment Method each month in the amount specified.  Notwithstanding the monthly amount you specify, if you exceed your available balance in any month, you will incur a debit balance; this debit balance will be deducted from the amount next billed to your Payment Method and the remaining balance will be credited to your account to pay for future charges.</p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight:bold">EFFECTS OF TERMINATION.</span>  None of the terms and conditions of these Payment Plan Program Terms will survive the termination of these Payment Plan Program Terms or the applicable Program Terms.</p></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="text-decoration:underline">API ACCESS PROGRAM TERMS</span></span> – If you participate in the API Access Program in a particular country, the following Program Terms apply. </p><ol class="bb-list" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li><p><span style="font-weight:bold">USE.</span>  If we grant you API Access in connection with a Program(s) (“<span style="font-weight:bold">API Access Program</span>”), API Access will be considered part of such Program(s).  “<span style="font-weight:bold">API Access</span>” is the ability, via the API Code, to access certain Program account information and/or features, and to execute commands for your Program account(s).
