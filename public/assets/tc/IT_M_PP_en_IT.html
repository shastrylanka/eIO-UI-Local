    PRIVACY POLICY
</p>
<p>
    YAHOO! ITALIA S.R.L. ADVERTISING SERVICES
</p>
<p>
    Please read this privacy policy in order to understand what information may be collected by the data controller, how these will be used, and what options
has the Data Subject for the use and sharing of these information while using the Yahoo! sites and, in particular, the pages located at    <a href="http://searchmarketing.yahoo.it/">http://searchmarketing.yahoo.it</a> (the “Yahoo! Sites”).
</p>
<p>
    The Yahoo Sites are owned by Yahoo! Italia S.r.l. (“Yahoo”), a company incorporated in Italy (VAT Number 13122290151) with its registered office at Milan,
    Via Spadolini 7, and its licensors. Yahoo! is the data controller pursuant to Legislative Decree 196/2003. Yahoo is a company of Yahoo Group.
</p>
<p>
    Any professional, user, individual, sole trader, legal representative of a legal entity, agent on behalf of third parties, who, by accepting Yahoo! Italia
    Advertising Services Terms and Conditions, submits any listing for paid inclusion in the Yahoo! Sites and/or in the Yahoo! search engine (hereinafter,
    “Advertisers”), including Sponsored Search and Display Programs (each of these limited to its respective area of applicability), agrees to the collection
    and processing (including cross boarder disclosures and data flow) of its information in accordance with this privacy policy. The provision of Yahoo’s
    advertising services is subject to the acceptance by the Advertiser of this processing. The lack of acceptance of this privacy policy and of the processing
    described herein will therefore determine the impossibility to provide the services at issue to the Advertiser.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. Types of information we collect and how we use it </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Yahoo may collect the following information, which will be processed by either paper or automatic means in strict compliance with current applicable data
    protection laws and in accordance with this privacy policy:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. Contact Information: </strong>
</p>
<p>
    For advertisers accepting Yahoo! Italia Advertising Services Terms and Conditions, Yahoo may request and collect, starting from the first registration of a
    new account, any useful information, such as the contact information of the person within the Advertiser as well as other personal data, such as the
    company name, the name of the legal representative, where applicable, an email address and a telephone number, the address and other work-related
    information about the Advertiser.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em></em></strong>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>2. Email addresses and related information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There may be opportunities for users visiting the Yahoo! Sites (“Users”) to give their consent to receive email communications by opting in to receive
    email marketing messages: for this purpose, Yahoo requests to the Users to give their express consent. Users may subscribe to the service by providing
    their email address and the other requested information and therefore agree that Yahoo uses their information in accordance with this privacy policy and
    with any applicable law. Subject to the provision of such express consent, Yahoo, may use the information provided by Users, similarly to the ones provided
    by the Advertisers, to send them information and updates on other products and services provided by Yahoo or by other companies of the group. These
    information may be sent to you also by third parties who have been specifically appointed to act on our behalf (e.g. a supplier of email delivery
    services). The recipients of the email marketing messages will have the opportunity to unsubscribe from future messages from Yahoo or third parties acting
    on behalf of Yahoo, via the link(s) included in the relevant message. For the avoidance of doubt, Yahoo will ensure that any such third party is obliged
    to: provide security guarantees; act only upon Yahoo instructions; and comply with the same security requirements applied by Yahoo.
</p>
<p>
    Users may have the opportunities to use other Yahoo! products or services for which other information are necessarily required. These information will be
    used in accordance with this privacy policy, with Yahoo! Privacy Policy, with any other applicable privacy policy and with Yahoo! Italia Advertising
    Services Terms and Conditions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. Cookies and web beacons </strong>
</p>
<p>
    When Users visit the Sites, cookies and web beacons will be used by Yahoo as follows: <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>(a) Cookies</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of User’s computer’s hard disk so that the website can recognise
    such computer when the User visit such web page later.
</p>
<p>
    A cookie typically contains the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated
    unique number.
</p>
<p>
    When the User visits our Sites, Yahoo sends a cookie. In particular, Yahoo uses cookies for various purposes, namely to:
</p>
<p>
    - recognize information related to the User’s Computer, so to provide customized content or remember the last visited page of a Yahoo product or service;
</p>
<p>
    - keep track of preferences specified by the User while using Yahoo products or services;
</p>
<p>
    - display the most appropriate advertising banners and content, based on the User’s interests and activity;
</p>
<p>
    - provide general internal and customer analytics;
</p>
<p>
    - conduct research to improve Yahoo's content, products and services;
</p>
<p>
    - improve security measures such as requiring re-logging into a Yahoo product or service after a certain amount of time has elapsed;
</p>
<p>
    - assist in identifying possible fraudulent activities.
</p>
<p>
    User can configure his/her browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify when a cookie is set. Each browser is different, so it is
    preferable that the User checks the "Help" menu of his/her browser to learn how to change his/her cookie preferences.
</p>
<p>
    If all cookies are rejected, the use of Yahoo’s products or services by the User on the Sites that require a "sign in" may be jeopardized and, therefore,
    the User may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings available on Yahoo. <strong><em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>(b) Web beacons</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Web pages may contain an electronic file, called “web beacon”, that allows a web site to count the number of users who have visited that page or to access
    certain cookies. Yahoo uses web beacons within its network in order to count the number of users and to recognise users’ computer, through cookies and only
    in case the User has already visited Yahoo. If the User rejects cookies, the web beacon tracking technology will still operate but it will not be able to
    link the activities of a specific browser from one session to another session.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>(c) Other uses of Cookies and web beacons</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Yahoo offers to the Advertisers tools that allow them to better understand the performance of their online marketing campaigns with Yahoo (“Yahoo! Analytic
    Tools”).
</p>
<p>
    In order to use these Yahoo! Analytic Tools, an Advertiser may add Yahoo! Analytic Tools web beacons to its web sites. These web beacons are electronic
    files served by either <em>perf.overture.com</em> or <em>yahoo.com </em>that enable Yahoo to collect anonymous information from the users of the
    Advertiser's sites via cookies. These web beacons collect only anonymous non-personally identifiable information and the URL of the web page where the web
    beacon is located. Yahoo! maintains the data of each Advertiser separately.
</p>
<p>
    The data collected are used to create aggregate reports for the Advertisers. No individual level data related to Users is shared with the Advertiser.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the above, Yahoo's email delivery vendor may use web beacons and cookies within HTML email messages sent on our behalf.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(d) Opt-out</strong>
    <br/>
    It is possible to <a></a><a href="https://login.marketingsolutions.yahoo.com/adui/signin/loadOptOut.do?l=it_IT">opt-out</a>
    <a
        id="_anchor_1"
        href="file:///C:/Users/sriranjp/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/LJCXYLBY/PRIVACY%20POLICY%20IT-EN%20(03102013).docx#_msocom_1"
        name="_msoanchor_1"
    >
        [Y1]
    </a>
    from the collection of the information referred to in letter (c) above via web beacons. Cookies will need to be enabled in order to activate the opt-out
    function.
</p>
<p>
    Note: This opt-out applies to a specific browser rather than a specific user. Therefore it will be necessary to opt-out separately from each computer or
    browser which is used. Additionally, the opt-out applies to web beacons only and not to other tools and cookies used by Yahoo.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4. Promotions and sweepstakes</strong>
</p>
<p>
    From time to time, Yahoo may sponsor or host promotions and sweepstakes where we collect information about Users. The possibility to use and share these
    information will be specified in the applicable terms of each promotion and sweepstakes or on the sign-up page.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>5. IP addresses and information specifically related to your computer</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When a User visits our Sites, Yahoo is allowed to log the corresponding IP address. In addition to this, Yahoo collects the information that the browser of
    the User’s computer automatically releases, such as information about the operating system and the browser version. When the browser or the email
    application used by the User requests a web page or email from another computer on the Internet, it automatically provides that computer with the address
    where it should send the information. This is called "IP address" (IP stands for "Internet protocol.") For most of the users accessing the Internet from a
    dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time they log on. It is, however, possible to trace the user with the
    assistance of the ISP.
</p>
<p>
    Yahoo, therefore, receives IP addresses from all Users because this information is automatically reported by the browser each time a User views a web page.
</p>
<p>
    IP addresses may be used for various purposes, namely to:
</p>
<p>
    · provide targeted advertisements and personalised services to the Users based on their IP address;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        trace out fraudulent activity;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · identify service or technology problems reported by the Users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company
    or ISP;
</p>
<p>
    · provide analytics with respect to the Users from specific countries or regions of the world;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        log a request on our servers when a Yahoo web page is requested and viewed.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>II. Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Yahoo may share information about the Users and Advertisers to other companies of the Yahoo! Group, also located outside the European Community, or to
    third companies Yahoo is acquired by, acquires or is merged with. In such event, Yahoo! will send a proper notification before any information is disclosed
    and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
    Yahoo may (for the purposes specified in this privacy policy) disclose information about the Users and Advertisers to joint ventures companies, also at a
    worldwide level and, therefore, outside the European Community. More information on Yahoo! group activities and companies of the Yahoo! Group is available
    here: <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/">http://info.yahoo.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Yahoo may (for general data management and account administration purposes) also transfer information about the Users and Advertisers to a jurisdiction,
    including the United States of America, Japan and Korea, which may not provide the same level of protection for that information as the one provided by
    Italian jurisdiction. <strong><em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Yahoo! has implemented reasonable technical and organisational measures designed to secure Users’ personal information from accidental loss and from
    unauthorised access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, the nature of the Internet is such that information may flow over networks without appropriate
    security measures and may be accessed and used by unauthorised persons.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that we may also share information in the event that Yahoo! is asked to respond to court orders or other legal proceeding or as otherwise
    required or permitted by law.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III.Other</strong>
    <br/>
    Yahoo! may update this policy from time to time and will notify any significant changes related to the processing of personal information by placing a
    prominent notice on the Sites or by contacting the Users and Advertisers in writing (including by email).
</p>
<p>
    The Sites are not targeted to children and are not intended for use by children under the age of 13.
</p>
<p>
    Subject to the applicable laws, the Data Subjects have the right (pursuant to article 7 of Legislative Decree 196/2003) to receive certain information as
    to whether or not information about them is collected and processed by Yahoo and to obtain a copy of such requested information. You also have the right to
    request, where appropriate, that any information is erased, blocked or made anonymous (although this may affect the use of the Sites, or Yahoo products or
    services) or to have data updated or corrected.
</p>
<p>
    Yahoo is not responsible for the practices or policies, or content, of web sites other than the Sites, including any site that directs Users to the Sites
    from other sites with a Yahoo! domain. The processing of information by those third parties’ sites may not be compliant with this privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
    If you have any questions or wish to contact Yahoo about this privacy policy, or about any information which is held by the Company, or if you want to
    change the sort of information that Yahoo may have collected, or if you want to exercise the rights granted to you according to article 7 of Legislative
    Decree 196/2003 please contact:
