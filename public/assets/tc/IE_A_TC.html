applicable law, and you shall pay such charges, without offset or deduction,
within 30 days of the invoice date. If we agree to your request to send an

<br>
<br>
&quot;API Access&quot; is the ability, via the API Code, to access certain
account information and/or features, and to execute commands for your
account(s).&nbsp; You may not use your API Access, including any data obtained,
for purposes other than managing your account(s) to which the API Access
relates.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your use of a <span class=SpellE>Programme</span>
terminates, your API Access to that <span class=SpellE>Programme</span> shall
terminate immediately.&nbsp; We may limit, modify or terminate your API Access,
at our discretion, at any time, and such modifications may require you to make
changes, at your expense, to the API Code for continued API Access.&nbsp;
&quot;API Code&quot; is software created by you or us using an XML/SOAP
interface we specify enabling API Access. <br>
<br>
If we give you API Code or software to incorporate into API Code developed by
you, we grant you a non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-<span

API Access during the term of the applicable <span class=SpellE>Programme</span>
Terms. You shall make the API Code available to us upon our request for our
review and notify us of the features and functionality of such API Code and the
application to which the API Code connects.&nbsp; Your use of API Code shall
not exceed access frequency limits as set by us from time to time.&nbsp; If you
are a Representative (defined below) this Section gives you (not the
Advertisers), API Access.&nbsp; You may not use API Access pursuant to this
Section if you are party to another agreement with a Yahoo! Company that
provides for such access.<br>
