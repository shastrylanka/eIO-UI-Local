respect to Class 2 Ads (as defined below), Yahoo will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the deliverable(s) to Customer as set forth in
the Insertion Order (&quot;Deliverable&quot;) on the network of advertising
channels, including all forms of media, applications, and devices, through
which Yahoo distributes ads, whether on or off the Yahoo Company Websites
(&quot;Distribution Network&quot;).&nbsp; &quot;Yahoo Company Websites&quot;
means all the website pages, including any microsite, that are owned, operated,
authorized, or hosted by or for Yahoo, Yahoo! Inc or an Affiliate of Yahoo or
Yahoo! Inc. (each, a &quot;Yahoo Company&quot;).&nbsp; &quot;Affiliate&quot;
means, with respect to an entity, any other entity that directly or indirectly
controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such entity.
Customer shall ensure that the Deliverable complies with the Yahoo! Advertising
Policy Guidelines attached here.&nbsp; Notwithstanding any line item breakout
in the Insertion Order and subject to Customer's full compliance of its
obligations in these Standard Terms (including without limitation submitting
the Content (as defined below) to Yahoo within Yahoo's stipulated time frame), Yahoo
is only obligated to deliver the aggregate number of impressions in the
Insertion Order as a whole, except that such obligation shall not apply in
respect of Class 2 Ads. Yahoo has no obligations to deliver
&quot;click-throughs&quot; or &quot;acquisitions&quot;.&nbsp; Unless the
Insertion Order requires Yahoo to deliver an aggregate number of impressions or
to place the Deliverable on a specific Yahoo property or page, (i) Yahoo has no
obligation to publish, post or otherwise deliver any impressions in any Yahoo
property, (ii) Yahoo makes no guarantees with respect to the method Yahoo uses
for measuring delivery or with respect to the accuracy of Yahoo's measurement
and (iii) the positioning of Deliverable within the Distribution Network
(including without limitation timing of delivery) is at Yahoo's sole
discretion.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

guaranteed to appear in the Distribution Network, and are designated as such in
the Insertion Order. Customer's charges for Class 2 Ads are based on actual
delivery of impressions as measured by Yahoo. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in the Insertion Order, Yahoo makes no guarantees with
respect to impressions for any Class 2 Ad.</span></p>

color:#666666'>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Metrics.&nbsp;&nbsp; The CPM, CPC or
CPA amount for any campaign shall be specified in the Insertion Order or
otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.&nbsp; For the purposes of
calculating CPA campaigns, an action (&quot;Action&quot;) occurs when a user
clicks on or is exposed to the Deliverable on the Distribution Network and
subsequently visits the Advertiser Website within the negotiated time frame and
triggers the delivery of the Conversion Pixel to the user.&nbsp;
&quot;Conversion Pixels&quot; means Yahoo's tags (or the tags of third party
nominated by Yahoo) on the confirmation page or any other code or file inserted
or placed by Yahoo (or third party nominated by Yahoo) on the Advertiser
Website for the purposes of calculating the charges due from Customer.&nbsp;
The fees payable by Customer shall be the number of Actions (if any) multiplied
by the CPA and subject to any overall caps agreed by Customer and Yahoo in
writing.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Yahoo will use
commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such budget caps, however
Customer agrees that it will pay for any monthly fees that exceed any such
budget cap.&nbsp; Yahoo shall, in its sole discretion (a) decide the placement,
timing, frequency, and number of ad units or impressions delivered, which in
turn may impact the number of Actions, and (b) calculate the monthly fees based
on its own measurements or those of its third party service providers.&nbsp;
For dynamically priced campaigns, the effective CPM will be determined based on
Customer's target goals (e.g. CPC, CPA, or CPM).&nbsp; Customer hereby gives
Yahoo the right to adjust the location of and price for the Deliverable (if
any) as long as the overall effective CPM does not exceed any budget caps
agreed by the parties.&nbsp; When Customer uses a Yahoo-approved third party ad
server, which cannot account for dynamic pricing, Yahoo will report total cost
to Customer in order for Customer to accurately determine the effective CPM.</span></p>

gif or jpeg files or other similar file format for graphic or image displaying,
all audio and audiovisual materials, data, images, files, scripts, hypertext
links, including updates, modification and enhancements thereof licensed by
Customer to Yahoo hereunder and provided by Customer to Yahoo (together,
&quot;Content&quot;)) for the Deliverable.&nbsp; Customer shall deliver at its
own cost the Content to Yahoo in accordance with Yahoo's policies in effect
from time to time, including (without limitation) the time and manner of
transmission to Yahoo. Yahoo shall not be required to publish any Deliverable the
Content of which is not received in accordance with such policies, and will not
issue any credit or make good due to late or incorrectly submitted Content
and/or late or incomplete information.&nbsp;In case of any rescheduling of the
launch of the Deliverable, Customer agrees that Yahoo shall still charge for
the full cost of such Deliverable and the full cost of the launch of such
Deliverable on the Distribution Network (details in &quot;Rescheduling&quot; under the
section on &quot;Yahoo! Advertising Policy Guidelines&quot; below.)  All Content
submitted to Yahoo shall be in final draft.&nbsp; Yahoo will be responsible for
providing equipment and software necessary to incorporate the Content into the
Deliverables.&nbsp; Customer shall maintain and update the Content as appropriate
or necessary.&nbsp; Customer hereby grants Yahoo a non-exclusive, worldwide,
fully paid and irrevocable license to (a) use, modify, reproduce, distribute,
display and transmit the Content in electronic form on the Distribution Network
via the Internet, any wireless device and/or third party networks (including,
without limitation, telephone and wireless networks); and (b) reproduce,

must link directly to the Advertiser's web site to which the Deliverable is
related (&quot;Advertiser Website&quot;), without intervening redirects or pop
up windows.&nbsp; Customer may not state or imply that Yahoo endorses or is the

Deliverable contains a contest, sweepstakes or other promotional offer
(collectively a &quot;Promotion&quot;), it will be subject to Yahoo's approval
and will be conducted in accordance with Yahoo's then-current terms with
respect to such Promotion.&nbsp; Notwithstanding Yahoo's approval or assistance
in connection with a Promotion, Customer will be responsible for the content of
such Promotion (including but not limited to the official rules governing such
Promotion), obtaining the necessary consents and licenses (including but not
limited to the trade promotion competition license) for the Promotion and the
acquisition and fulfillment of all prizes in connection with such Promotion and

any Promotion by Yahoo will not constitute an opinion as to the legal
appropriateness, accuracy or adequacy of such rules or their manner of
use.&nbsp; Customer acknowledges that the application(s) used for the Promotion

Insertion Order may be modified through an e-mail exchange whereby one party
sets forth proposed new terms and the other party confirms such terms (an
&quot;Email Modification&quot;), and the scope of an Email Modification may
only encompass changes (as applicable) to the pricing type (CPM, CPC, CPA etc),
the budget cap (including the impression goal total, the dollar value total and
the unit cost), the targeting, the flight dates, the frequency cap, and/or the

the confirmation e-mail; and (ii) Yahoo may change these Standard Terms at any
time by making them available on the Yahoo Company Websites and/or by providing
notice in accordance with clause 19(h). If Customer does not agree to such
amended Standard Terms, it must immediately notify Yahoo in writing. The
absence of such immediate notice and/or Customer's continued use of the
Deliverable shall be deemed to be acceptance by Customer of the amended
Standard Terms. <br>

unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
permissible, and the other provisions of the Insertion Order will remain in

legally binding terms.&nbsp; Customer accepts the Insertion Order and the
terms, conditions, and notices contained or referenced herein by clicking on
